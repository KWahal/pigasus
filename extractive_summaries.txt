(6) ``Nonfee cost differential'' means a value calculated 
        annually by the Secretaries by multiplying the weighted 
        difference in nonfee costs per AUM between public land and 
        private land by the Input Cost Index (ICI) determined annually 
        by the Department of Agriculture.(a) Findings.--Congress finds and declares that--
            (1) it is in the national interest that the public lands 
        are producing and continue to produce water and soil 
        conservation benefits, livestock forage, wildlife forage and 
        recreation and other multiple use opportunities;
            (2) rangelands will continue to be stabilized and improved 
        long term by providing for cooperative agreements, private, 
        public partnerships and flexibility in management programs and 
        agreements;
            (3) to assure sound management and stewardship of the 
        renewable resources it is imperative to charge a fee that is 
        reasonable and equitable and represents the fair value of the 
        forage provided;
            (4) the intermingled private-public land ownership patterns 
        prevailing in much of the west create a strong interdependence 
        between public and private lands for forage, water, and habitat 
        for both wildlife and livestock;
            (5) the social and economic infrastructure of many rural 
        communities and stability of job opportunities in many areas of 
        rural America are highly independent on the protection of the 
        value of privately held production units on Federal lands.

The weighted difference in 
        nonfee costs is a factor of 0.552 determined by deducting the 
        private AUM nonfee costs (as outlined on page 58 of the report) 
        from the public AUM nonfee costs for cattle times 4, added to 
        the result of deducting private AUM nonfee costs from public 
        AUM nonfee costs for sheep times 1, then that result divided by 
        5.''

(2) The United States Merchant Marine was integral in 
        providing the link between domestic production and the fighting 
        forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel, food, 
        commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed overseas.
            The United States will be forever grateful and 
        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, 
        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in 
        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World 
        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives 
        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.
            This Act may be cited as the ``Merchant Marine of World War II 
Congressional Gold Medal Act''.
