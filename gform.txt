TARGET
Existing law authorizes the State Water Resources Control Board to adopt regulations requiring measurement and reporting of water diversion and use by persons including, among others, those authorized to appropriate water under a permit, license, registration for small domestic, small irrigation, or livestock stockpond use, or a certification for livestock stockpond use.
This bill would restrict the state board’s authorization to adopt regulations requiring measurement and reporting of water diversion and use by persons authorized to appropriate water under a registration or certification to uses that are year-round.
Existing law requires a person who diverts 10 acre-feet of water per year or more under a permit or license to install and maintain a device or employ a method capable of measuring the rate of direct diversion, rate of collection to storage, and rate of withdrawal or release from storage, as specified, and with certain exceptions.
This bill would delay those requirements for 2 years.

(1)Existing law requires the State Water Resources Control Board to adopt regulations requiring measurement and reporting of water diversion and use by persons authorized to appropriate water under a permit, license, registration for small domestic, small irrigation, and livestock stockpond use, if the registered use is year-round, or certification for livestock stockpond use. Existing law requires the initial regulations to be adopted as emergency regulations and to be considered by the Office of Administrative Law as necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety, and general welfare. This bill would adopt emergency regulations requiring the board to adopt regulations requiring measurement and reporting of water diversion and use by persons authorized to appropriate water under a permit, license, registration for small domestic, small irrigation, and livestock stockpond use, if the registered use is year-round, or certification for livestock stockpond use. The initial regulations would require the board to adopt regulations requiring a person who, on or after January 1, 2018, diverts 10 acre-feet of water per year or more under a permit or license to install and maintain a device or employ a method capable of measuring the rate of direct diversion, rate of collection to storage, and rate of withdrawal or release from storage, as specified.

TARGET
The California Constitution requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented. Existing law, the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, requires the Department of Water Resources to update its model water-efficient landscape ordinance by regulation and prescribes various requirements for the updated model ordinance. Existing law requires each local agency to adopt either the updated model water-efficient landscape ordinance or an ordinance that is at least as effective in conserving water as the updated model ordinance. If the local agency does not make a selection, the model ordinance shall apply within the jurisdiction of the local agency.
This bill would require the department, upon identification of a funding source,
to create the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program for the purpose of encouraging local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances, and support and enhance water inefficient grass replacement. This bill would create the Water Efficient Landscaping Fund and provide that moneys in the fund are available, upon appropriation by the Legislature, to the department for certain purposes.

PIGASUS
(1) Existing law establishes the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program, which is administered by the Department of Water Resources, in partnership with the State Water Resources Control Board, the Central Valley Water Quality Control Board, and the Central Valley Water Quality Control Board, to promote water conservation, energy efficiency, and climate adaptation through the design and installation of landscape irrigation systems that reduce reliance on petroleum-based fertilizers and pesticides, as specified. The program requires, upon appropriation by the Legislature, 5% of the annual proceeds of the Water Efficient Landscaping Program Fund to be distributed to the Central Valley Water Quality Control Board for the purpose of implementing the program. This bill would increase the allocation of the program from 5% to 10%. The bill would create the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program Technical Advisory Council and would require the council, among other things, to prepare and provide to the council a standard operating procedure for the implementation of the program, as specified. The bill would also require the council to consult with the council’s membership and recommend the council’s next steps in implementing the program. (2) The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) requires all water agencies, except as specified, to comply with a water quality control ordinance adopted by the Central Valley Water Quality Control Board and promulgated by the Central Valley Water Quality Control

TARGET
Existing law provides for the administration and operation of juvenile court schools by the county board of education.
This bill would express the Legislature’s intent that juvenile court schools have a rigorous curriculum that includes a course of study that prepares pupils for high school graduation and career entry and fulfills the requirements for admission to the California State University and the University of California.
Existing law prescribes the course of study a pupil is required to complete while in grades 9 to 12, inclusive, in order to receive a diploma of graduation, and authorizes the governing board of a school district to prescribe other coursework requirements that are in addition to the statewide requirements. Existing law exempts pupils in foster care and pupils who are homeless children or youths from local graduation requirements and also requires a school district and county office of education to accept coursework satisfactorily completed by those pupils while attending another public school, a juvenile court school, or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school.
This bill would make that exemption and requirement to accept coursework satisfactorily completed applicable to former juvenile court school pupils, as defined. The bill would also require a county office of education to issue a diploma of graduation to a pupil who completes statewide coursework requirements for graduation while attending a juvenile court school but does not complete coursework and other requirements that are in addition to the statewide graduation requirements. By placing additional requirements on school districts and county offices of education, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.

PIGASUS
The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.
