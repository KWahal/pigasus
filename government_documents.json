[{"inputs": "<mask_1><mask_1>. In recent years, federal civilian personnel have deployed along with military personnel to participate in Operations Joint Endeavor, conducted in the countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Hungary; Joint Guardian, in Kosovo; and Desert <mask_1>torm, in Southwest Asia. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. For example, this information allows epidemiologists to study the incidences of disease patterns across populations of deployed servicemembers who may have been exposed to diseases and hazards within the theater, and health care professionals to treat their medical problems appropriately. Without location-specific information for all of its deployed federal civilians and centralized data in its department-level system, DOD limits its ability to ensure that sufficient and appropriate consideration will also be given to addressing the health care concerns of these individuals. DOD also had not provided guidance to the components that would require them to forward completed deployment health assessments for all federal civilians to the Army Medical Surveillance Activity (AMSA), where these assessments are suppose to be archived in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS), integrated with other historical and current data on personnel and deployments, and used to monitor the health of personnel who participate in deployments. The overall success of deployment force protection and surveillance efforts, in large measure, depends on the completeness of health assessment data. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In this regard, in August 2006, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness issued revised policy and program guidance that generally addressed the shortcomings in DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance capabilities. The revised policy and guidance, scheduled to become effective in December 2006, require the components within 3 years, to electronically report (at least weekly) to DMDC, location-specific data for all deployed personnel, including federal civilians. In addition, the policy and guidance require the components to submit all completed health assessment forms to the AMSA for inclusion in DMSS. Nonetheless, DOD\u2019s new policy is not comprehensive enough to ensure that the department will be sufficiently informed of the extent to which its components are complying with existing health protection requirements for its deployed federal civilians. Although the policy requires DOD components to report certain location-specific and health data for all of their deployed personnel, including federal civilians, it does not establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism for assessing and ensuring the full implementation of the force health protection and surveillance requirements by all DOD components that our prior work has identified as essential in providing care to military personnel. In a September 2003 report on the Army\u2019s and the Air Force\u2019s compliance with force health protection policy for servicemembers, we noted that neither of the military services had fully complied with DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies for many active duty servicemembers, including the policies requiring that servicemembers be assessed before and after deploying overseas and receive certain immunizations. We further noted that DOD, at that time, did not have an effective quality assurance program to provide oversight of, and ensure compliance with, the department\u2019s force health protection and surveillance requirements, and that the lack of such a system was a major cause of the high rate of noncompliance that we identified at the units we visited. In response to a legislative mandate and our recommendation, DOD established an oversight mechanism to evaluate the success of its force health protection and surveillance policies in ensuring that servicemembers received pre- and post-deployment medical examinations and that record-keeping requirements were met. This oversight mechanism included (1) periodic site visits jointly conducted with staff from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs and staff from the military services to assess compliance with the deployment health requirements, (2) periodic reports from the services on their quality assurance programs, and (3) periodic reports from AMSA on health assessment data maintained in the centralized database. Until the department provides a similar oversight and quality assurance mechanism for its deployed federal civilians, it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or ensure the health care and protection of these individuals as they continue to support contingency operations. DOD has established medical treatment policies that cover its federal civilians while they are deployed to support contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and available workers\u2019 compensation claims we reviewed confirmed that those deployed federal civilians received care consistent with the policies. <mask_1>. Thus, DOD\u2019s deployed federal civilians may receive care through the military\u2019s treatment facilities. As shown in figure 1, DOD\u2019s military health system provides four levels of medical care to personnel who are injured or become ill while deployed. Specifically, medical treatment during a military contingency begins with level one care, which consists of basic first aid and emergency care at a unit in the theater of operation. The treatment then moves to a second level of care, where, at an Aid station, injured or ill personnel are examined and evaluated to determine their priority for continued movement outside of the theater of operation and to the next (third) level of care. At the third level, injured or ill personnel are treated in a medical installation staffed and equipped for resuscitation, surgery, and postoperative care. Finally, at the fourth level of care, which occurs far from the theater of operation, injured or ill personnel are treated in a hospital staffed and equipped for definitive care. Injured or ill DOD federal civilians deployed in support of contingency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq who require level four medical care are transported to DOD\u2019s Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany. Injured or ill DOD federal civilians who cannot be returned to duty in theater are evacuated to the United States for continuation of medical care. In these cases (or where previously deployed federal civilians later identify injuries or diseases and subsequently request medical treatment), DOD\u2019s policy provides for its federal civilians who require treatment for deployment-related injuries or occupational illnesses to receive medical care through either the military\u2019s medical treatment facilities or civilian facilities. The policy stipulates that federal civilians who are injured or become ill as a result of their deployment must file a Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA) claim with DOD, which then files a claim with the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (OWCP). The Department of Labor\u2019s OWCP is responsible for making a decision to award or deny medical benefits. OWCP must establish\u2014based on evidence provided by the DOD civilian\u2014that the employee is eligible for workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to the injury or disease for which the benefits are claimed. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. DOD\u2019s medical treatment process and the OWCP\u2019s claims process are shown in figure 2. Overall, the claims we reviewed showed that the DOD federal civilians who sustained injuries or diseases while deployed had received care that was consistent with DOD\u2019s medical treatment policies. <mask_1>. For example, in one case, a deployed federal civilian was treated for traumatic injuries at a hospital outside of the theater of operation and could not return to duty in theater because of the severity of the injuries sustained. The civilian was evacuated to the United States and received medical care through several of the military\u2019s medical treatment facilities as well as through a civilian facility. <mask_1>. While OWCP has primary responsibility for processing and approving all FECA claims for medical benefits, as noted earlier, the scope of our review did not include assessing actions taken by the Department of Labor\u2019s OWCP in further processing workers\u2019 compensation claims for injured or ill civilians and authorizing continuation of medical care once their claims were submitted for review. <mask_1>. Both groups receive special pays, but the types and amounts differ. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Further, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive comparable types of cash survivor benefits\u2014lump sum, recurring, or both\u2014but benefit amounts differ for the two groups. <mask_1>. DOD federal civilian and military personnel are both eligible to receive special pays to compensate them for the conditions of deployment. As shown in table 5, some of the types of special pays are similar for both DOD federal civilian and military personnel, although the amounts paid to each group differ. Other special pays were unique to each group. DOD federal civilian and military personnel deployed to posts with unusually difficult or unhealthful conditions or severe physical hardships are authorized a similar type of post (hardship) differential. In addition, danger pay is granted to both groups serving at a post where civil insurrection, civil war, or war-like conditions exist. <mask_1>. In contrast, military personnel receive monthly pays of $100 for hardship duty and $225 for imminent danger. However, some special pays are unique to each group. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In the event of sustaining an injury while deployed, DOD federal civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive two broad categories of disability benefits\u2014disability compensation and disability retirement. However, the benefits applicable to each group vary by type and amount, depending on specific program provisions and individual circumstances. Within these broad categories, there are three main types of disability: (1) temporary disability, (2) permanent partial disability, and (3) permanent total disability. Both DOD federal civilian and military personnel who are injured in the line of duty are eligible to receive continuation of their pay during the initial period of treatment and may be eligible to receive recurring payments for lost wages. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In contrast, military personnel receive continuation of pay of their salary for generally no longer than a year, followed by a recurring VA disability compensation payment for wage loss that is based on the degree of disability and their number of dependents, and temporary DOD disability retirement for up to 5 years. Appendix II provides additional information on temporary disability compensation payments for federal civilian and military personnel. To illustrate the way in which the degree of impairment and an individual\u2019s salary can affect temporary disability compensation, in our April 2006 review, we compared the disability benefits available to military personnel with those available to comparable civilian public safety officers at the federal, state, and local levels. We found that VA compensation payments for military personnel were based on a disability rating, regardless of salary level; in contrast, compensation payments for civilian public safety officers were based on salary level, regardless of disability level. Thus, for an individual with severe injuries and relatively low wages, VA compensation payments for military personnel were generally higher than those of the civilian public safety officers included in the reviews. However, if an individual had less severe injuries and high wages, VA compensation payments for military personnel were generally lower than those of the civilian public safety officers included in the review. When a partial disability is determined to be permanent, DOD federal civilian and military personnel can continue to receive recurring compensation payments. <mask_1>. Military personnel are also eligible to receive recurring VA disability compensation payments for the remainder of their lives, and these payments are based on the severity of the servicemember\u2019s injury and the number of dependents. In addition, both groups are eligible to receive additional compensation payments beyond the recurring payments just discussed, based on the type of impairment. <mask_1>. Some impairments may result in benefits for a few weeks, while others may result in benefits for several years. Similarly, military personnel receive special monthly VA compensation payments depending on the specific type and degree of impairment. Appendix II provides more detailed information on permanent partial disability compensation payments for DOD federal civilian and military personnel. Our April 2006 review compared the compensation benefits available to military personnel with those available to federal civilian public safety officers, among others, using several scenarios. Our analysis showed that when able to return to duty, military personnel often received a greater amount of compensation benefits over a lifetime than did civilians, even when the monthly benefit payment was substantially lower and receipt of benefits was delayed for several years. Permanent partial disabilities that prevent civilian and military personnel from returning to duty in their current jobs may entitle them to receive disability retirement benefits based on a percentage of salary in addition to compensation benefits; however, the eligibility criteria and benefit amounts differ. <mask_1>. Under the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (FERS), civilian personnel must be unfit for duty and have 18 months of service. <mask_1>. Military personnel who are unfit for duty are eligible for DOD disability retirement benefits if they have a disability rating of 30 percent or more regardless of length of service, or if they have 20 years or more of service regardless of disability rating. The amount of the DOD disability retirement payment is offset dollar for dollar, however, by the amount of the monthly VA disability compensation payment unless they have at least 20 years of service and a disability rating of 50 percent or more, or combat-related disabilities. Our April 2006 review of disability benefits showed that when military personnel and federal civilian public safety officers were unable to return to duty due to a permanent partial disability, such as a leg amputation, the combined compensation and retirement benefits provided to the military personnel over a lifetime were sometimes more, and sometimes less, than the combined benefits provided to civilian public safety officers. When an injury is severe enough to be deemed permanent and total, DOD federal civilian and military personnel may receive similar types of benefits such as disability compensation and retirement payments; however, the amounts paid to each group vary. For civilian personnel, the monthly payment amounts for total disability are generally similar to those for permanent partial disability described earlier, but unlike with permanent partial disabilities, the payments do not take into account any wage earning capacity. Both groups are eligible to receive additional compensation payments beyond the recurring payments that are similar to those for permanent partial disability. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Military personnel receive special monthly VA compensation payments for particularly severe injuries, such as amputations, blindness, or other loss of use of organs and extremities. The payments are designed to account for attendant care or other special needs deriving from the disability. In addition to disability compensation, both DOD federal civilian and military personnel have access to disability retirement benefits for permanent total disabilities. The provisions for election and offset of disability compensation and disability retirement benefits in cases of permanent total disability are similar to provisions in cases of permanent partial disability discussed earlier. Another benefit available to DOD federal civilian and military personnel with permanent total disabilities is Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). SSDI benefits are available to individuals who incur a physical or mental impairment that prevents them from performing substantial gainful activity and that is expected to last at least 1 year or to result in death. The benefit is based on the employee\u2019s earnings history and lifetime contributions to Social Security; therefore, the benefit amounts vary widely among individuals. <mask_1>. The maximum benefit to both groups in 2006 was $2,053 per month. <mask_1>. Survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive similar types of cash survivor benefits\u2014either as a lump sum, a recurring payment, or both\u2014through comparable sources. However, the benefit amounts generally differ for each group. Survivors of DOD federal civilian and military personnel also receive noncash benefits that differ in type and amounts. As shown in table 8, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel both receive lump sum benefits in the form of Social Security, a death gratuity, burial expenses, and life insurance. Social Security provides $255 upon the death of a DOD federal civilian employee or military member. In addition, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian personnel receive a death gratuity of up to $10,000, while survivors of deceased military personnel receive $100,000. The payment for funeral expenses provided to survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian personnel can be as high as $800, plus $200 for costs associated with terminating employee status, while it can be $7,700 for deceased military personnel. Life insurance is another common source of benefits for the survivors of many deceased civilian and military personnel. <mask_1>. Military personnel automatically are insured as part of the Servicemembers\u2019 Group Life Insurance for up to $400,000, unless they elect less or no coverage. <mask_1>. Survivors of deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel are also eligible for recurring benefits, some of which are specific to each group, as shown in table 9. Survivors of both deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel may be eligible to receive recurring Social Security payments based on the deceased individual\u2019s earnings in a covered period. However, other types of recurring payments are specific to either civilian or military personnel. <mask_1>. Survivors of deceased military personnel also receive payments through the Survivor Benefit Plan, Dependency and Indemnity Compensation, or both. In addition to lump sum and recurring benefits, survivors of deceased DOD federal civilians and military personnel receive noncash benefits. As shown in table 10, survivors of deceased military personnel receive more noncash benefits than do those of deceased DOD federal civilian personnel, with few benefits being comparable in type. For example, eligible survivors of military personnel who die while on active duty obtain benefits such as rent-free government housing or tax- free housing allowances for up to 365 days, relocation assistance, and lifetime access to commissaries and exchanges that are not available to civilian personnel who die in the line-of-duty. However, survivors of both deceased DOD federal civilian and military personnel do continue to receive health insurance that is wholly or partially subsidized. As DOD\u2019s federal civilian employees assume an expanding role in helping the department support its contingency operations overseas, the need for attention to the policies and benefits that affect the health and welfare of these individuals becomes increasingly significant. DOD currently has important policies in place that relate to the deployment of its federal civilians. However, it lacks an adequate oversight and quality assurance mechanism to ensure compliance and quality of service. Thus, not all of its policies\u2014such as those that define the department\u2019s requirements for force health protection and surveillance\u2014are being fully implemented by the DOD components. <mask_1>. To strengthen DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance for its federal civilian personnel who deploy in support of contingency operations, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to establish an oversight and quality assurance mechanism to ensure that all components fully comply with its requirements. In written comments on a draft of this report, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation. The department acknowledged the necessity for all deployed civilians to receive required medical assessments and immunizations, and that documentation must be available in every instance. The department outlined several steps it intends to take to determine appropriate implementation of our recommendation. <mask_1>. While DOD\u2019s response is encouraging, we remain concerned that the department\u2019s description of the actions it plans to take to assess the components\u2019 compliance with its requirements lacks sufficient detail. DOD was unable to provide us with a copy of the new instruction; thus, we could not evaluate the comprehensiveness of its new force health protection quality assurance program or determine whether the program identifies specific actions the department plans to take for assessing and ensuring the full implementation of the force health protection and surveillance requirements by all DOD components. DOD also stated that proposed revisions to its directives and instructions that address the planning, preparation, and utilization of DOD civilians include, among other things, annual assessments for compliance with pre-and post-deployment medical assessment requirements. However, the department did not describe what actions, if any, it plans to take to ensure that it will be sufficiently informed of the extent to which its components are complying with existing health protection requirements for its deployed federal civilians. In the absence of more specific details on its planned actions, we continue to emphasize the department\u2019s need for a comprehensive oversight and quality assurance mechanism without which it will not be effectively positioned to ensure compliance with its policies, or ensure the health care and protection of its deployed federal civilians as they continue to support contingency operations. In addition to its comments on our recommendation, the department took issue with some of our specific findings. DOD questioned our findings that in many cases DOD components were unable to produce documentation confirming that deployed federal civilians had received necessary pre- or post-deployment medical assessments, or immunizations. The department stated that DOD activities, particularly regarding the Army Corps of Engineers, Transatlantic Programs Center (TPC), had determined that documentation did exist for many records included in our review, thus raising reservations about our findings. In particular, the department stated that the number (and percent) of records missing two or more immunizations that we reported for TPC was inaccurate. It stated that based on TPC\u2019s review of the specific documentation that we used to support our findings, we had actually identified 69 records (54.3 percent) as missing two or more immunizations, rather than 85 (66.9 percent) noted in our draft report. We disagree. TPC overlooked 16 records included in our review that lacked documentation of any immunizations. Moreover, as we noted in our report, to provide assurances that the results of our review of hard copy deployment records at the selected component locations were accurate, we requested that each component\u2019s designated medical personnel reexamine those deployment records that we determined were missing required health documentation. We then adjusted our results in those instances where documentation was subsequently provided. To provide additional assurances regarding our determinations, we requested that each component\u2019s designated medical personnel review and sign the data collection instrument that we used to collect deployment health information from each individual civilian\u2019s deployment record attesting to our conclusions regarding the existence of health assessment or immunization documentation. DOD also stated that we inappropriately mixed discussion of Veterans Affairs and DOD benefits without distinguishing between the two. However, our report appropriately discusses two broad categories of \u201cgovernment-provided\u201d benefits: (1) those provided by DOD and (2) those provided by VA. Nonetheless, to further clarify this section of our report, we added \u201cVA\u201d and \u201cDOD\u201d to our discussions of disability compensation and retirement benefits for military personnel. DOD also stated that our discussion of military disability benefits presented incorrect information in many cases, indicating that our statements that compensation payments for military personnel were based on a disability rating, regardless of salary level is only true with regard to VA disability benefits. DOD also stated that DOD disability payments do, in fact, take into account salary level, and that if a former member is entitled to both, there is an offsetting mechanism. We agree. As we state in our report, under veterans\u2019 compensation programs, benefits typically include cash payments to replace a percentage of the individual\u2019s loss in wages while injured and unable to work. We also state that disability retirement benefits for military personnel are based on a percent of salary in addition to compensation benefits, and that the amount of retirement payment is offset dollar for dollar by the amount of monthly compensation payment unless military personnel have at least 20 years of service and a disability rating of 50 percent or more, or have combat-related disabilities. Further, DOD submitted detailed comments related to our analysis of special pays and benefits provided to deployed DOD federal civilian and military personnel. In particular, the department stated that our selection and presentation of the associated data on the special pays and benefits provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel could easily mislead the reader into drawing erroneous conclusions. The department also stated that our comparisons did not take into account the relative value of certain key benefits for which explicit dollar amounts cannot be measured, such as retirement systems, health care systems, and military commissary exchange privileges. To the contrary, our report did discuss this limitation, and as is the case with any modeled scenarios based on certain assumptions, some of the factors with the potential to affect the overall outcomes of our comparisons could not be included because of, as DOD pointed out, the relative value of certain key benefits for which explicit dollar amounts cannot be measured. It is partly for this reason that we acknowledged in the report that we do not take a position on the adequacy or appropriateness of the special pays and benefits provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel. DOD also requested that we clearly acknowledge the fundamental differences between the military and civilians systems. We believe that we have done so. As we noted in our report, we did not make direct analytical comparisons between compensation and benefits offered by DOD to deployed federal civilian and military personnel because such comparisons must account for the demands of the military service, such as involuntary relocation, frequent and lengthy separations from family, and liability for combat. DOD provided other technical comments, which we have incorporated as appropriate. The department\u2019s comments are reprinted in their entirety in appendix III. We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Senate Committee on Armed Services; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, House Committee on Armed Services; the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Defense, Senate Committee on Appropriations; and the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Defense, House Committee on Appropriations; and other interested congressional parties. We are also sending copies to the Secretary of Defense and the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. We will make copies available to other interested parties upon request. Copies of this report will also be made available at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix IV. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. Because DOD had difficulty identifying the total number of federal civilians who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq, we assessed the implementation of DOD\u2019s deployment health requirements at eight component locations that were selected using a number of approaches. Given that DOD components have flexibility in where they conduct deployment processing, we selected locations for our review accordingly. Specifically, the Army uses a centralized approach, deploying its federal civilians at three primary locations; therefore, we selected all three locations for review. By contrast, the Navy and Air Force use a decentralized approach, deploying their federal civilians from their home stations. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. DCMA has an informal agreement with the Army to process its federal civilians through two of the Army\u2019s three deployment locations. Therefore, DCMA federal civilian deployment data in this report are included in the Army results to the extent that DCMA federal civilian deployments were documented at the two relevant Army locations. <mask_1>. Table 11 shows the locations included in our review and the number of deployment records reviewed at each location. <mask_1>. Specifically, we reviewed hard copies of deployment records for 454 (out of a reported 822) federal civilian personnel at seven component locations and automated deployment records for 2,977 (out of the reported 2,977) federal civilian personnel at the other location where all deployment records were being maintained electronically. The results of deployment record reviews, however, could not be projected beyond the samples to all DOD federal civilians who had deployed during this time frame. <mask_1>. For federal civilians in our review at each location, we reviewed deployment records for documentation that the following force health protection and surveillance policy requirements were met: Pre-and post-deployment health assessments; Tuberculosis screening test (within 1 year of deployment); Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) screening test; Pre-deployment immunizations: hepatitis A (first and second course); influenza (within 1 year of deployment); tetanus-diphtheria (within 10 years of deployment); typhoid; and smallpox (within 5 years of deployment) After our review of hard copy deployment records, we requested each component\u2019s medical personnel to reexamine those hard copy deployment records that were missing required health documentation, and we adjusted our results where documentation was subsequently provided. We also requested and queried other documentation from information systems used by the components to capture deployment and related health information, making adjustments to our results where documentation was found in the systems. These data sources included the Army\u2019s Medical Protection System (MEDPROS), the Army\u2019s medical database (MedBase), the Air Force\u2019s Preventive Health Assessment and Individual Medical Readiness (PIMR) system and its Comprehensive Immunization Tracking Application (CITA), DOD\u2019s Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS), which is used by the Navy, and the Army Medical Surveillance Activity\u2019s Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS). At the Army\u2019s Fort Benning, we created a sampling frame (i.e., total population) of records for 606 federal civilian deployments between June 1, 2003, and September 30, 2005. <mask_1>. We then drew a stratified random sample of 288 deployment records and stratified the sample to isolate potential duplicate deployment records for the same federal civilian. We found two duplicate records and removed them from both the population and sample, as shown in table 12. We also removed another 14 deployment records from our sample because those DOD federal civilians had been deployed to locations other than Afghanistan or Iraq, and were not eligible for the duty population. In addition, we removed another 13 deployment records that were originally selected as potential replacement records; however, we found that those replacements were not needed. Ultimately, we identified 238 in-scope responses, for a weighted response rate of 87 percent. Each sampled record was subsequently weighted in the analysis to represent all DOD federal civilians deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. The disposition of the federal civilian deployment records we reviewed at Fort Benning are summarized in the following table: Our probability sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Because each sample could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the Fort Benning, Ga., samples we could have drawn. All percentage estimates from our sample have margins of error (that is, widths of confidence intervals) of plus or minus 5 percentage points or less, at the 95 percent confidence level, unless otherwise noted. We took steps to assess the reliability of DOD federal civilian deployment and health data for the purposes of this review, including consideration of issues such as the completeness of the data from the respective information systems\u2019 program managers and administrators. We also examined whether the data were subjected to quality control measures such as periodic testing of the data against deployment records to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data. In addition, we reviewed existing documentation related to the data sources and interviewed knowledgeable agency officials about the data. <mask_1>. In those instances where we did not find a deployment health assessment or immunization in either the deployment records or in the electronic data systems, we concluded that the health assessment or immunization was not documented. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We selected and reviewed a non-probability sample of claims to assess the components\u2019 processes and procedures for implementing DOD\u2019s medical treatment policies across a range of civilian casualties including injuries, physical and mental illnesses, and diseases. The scope of our review did not extend to the Department of Labor\u2019s claims review process. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>.S.<mask_1>.S.<mask_1>.S.<mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. In addition, we discussed the statutes and guidance with cognizant officials of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, military services\u2019 headquarters, and the Defense Contract Management Agency involved with the administration of active duty and federal civilian personnel entitlements. <mask_1>. Our analysis focused on selected elements of compensation such as special pays (e.g., hostile fire/imminent danger pay). Also, we did not make direct analytical comparisons between compensation and benefits offered by DOD to deployed federal civilian and military personnel because such comparisons must account for the demands of the military service, such as involuntary relocation, frequent and lengthy separations from family, and liability for combat. <mask_1>. We interviewed DOD officials to discuss the basis for any differences in compensation. In addition, to illustrate how special pays affect overall compensation provided to DOD federal civilian and military personnel, we modeled scenarios for both groups using similar circumstances, such as length of deployment, pay grades, special pays (e.g., post differential pay, danger pay, overtime pay, family separation allowance, basic allowance for housing, basic allowance for subsistence), and duty location. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We assumed that the military personnel would contribute a smaller percentage of pay, 5 percent of gross income, to TSP. We made this assumption because much of the military pay was not subject to federal taxes, which removes the incentive to contribute to TSP, and because unlike for federal workers, military TSP does not have a matching component. For military personnel, we also deducted the amount of pay not subject to taxes due to the combat zone exclusion, family separation allowance, basic allowance for subsistence, and basic allowance for housing. Using these assumptions, we generated an adjusted gross income and used that as input into a commercial tax program, Turbo Tax, to obtain federal taxes owed. We assumed that both DOD federal civilian and military personnel were married, filing jointly, with a spouse that earned no income. We assumed that the family had two children and qualified for two child tax credits, and the Earned Income Tax Credit, if at that income level. This resulted in four exemptions and a standard deduction of $10,000 in 2005. For purposes of validation, we repeated this exercise using an alternate tax program, Tax Cut, and obtained identical results. We conducted our review from March 2006 to August 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Both DOD federal civilian and military personnel are eligible to receive disability benefits when they sustain a line-of-duty injury. However, these benefits vary in amount. Table 13 shows the temporary disability benefits available to eligible DOD federal civilian and military personnel. <mask_1>. In contrast, military personnel receive continuation of their salaries for generally no longer than a year, followed by a recurring payment for wage loss, which is based on the degree of disability and their number of dependents, and temporary retirement pay based on salary for up to 5 years. When a partial disability is determined to be permanent, both DOD federal civilians and military personnel are eligible to continue receiving recurring compensation payments, but again, the amounts of these benefits vary, as shown in table 14. <mask_1>.

The structure of the armed forces is based on the Total Force concept, which recognizes that all elements of the structure\u2014active duty military personnel, reservists, defense contractors, host nation military and civilian personnel, and DOD federal civilian employees\u2014contribute to national defense. In recent years, federal civilian personnel have deployed along with military personnel to participate in Operations Joint Endeavor, conducted in the countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, and Hungary; Joint Guardian, in Kosovo; and Desert Storm, in Southwest Asia. S. Further, since the beginning of the Global War on Terrorism, the role of DOD\u2019s federal civilian personnel has expanded to include participation in combat support functions in Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. DOD relies on the federal civilian personnel it deploys to support a range of essential missions, including intelligence collection, criminal investigations, and weapon systems acquisition and maintenance. To ensure that its federal civilian employees will deploy to combat zones and perform critical combat support functions in theater, DOD established the emergency-essential program in 1985. Under this program, DOD designates as \u201cemergency-essential\u201d those civilian employees whose positions are required to ensure the success of combat operations or the availability of combat-essential systems. DOD can deploy federal civilian employees either on a voluntary or involuntary basis to accomplish the DOD mission. DOD has established force health protection and surveillance policies aimed at assessing and reducing or preventing health risks for its deployed federal civilian personnel; however, the department lacks procedures to ensure the components\u2019 full implementation of its policies. In reviewing DOD federal civilian deployment records and other electronic documentation at selected component locations, we found that these components lacked documentation to show that they had fully complied with DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policy requirements for some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. As a larger issue, DOD\u2019s policies did not require the centralized collection of data on the identity of its deployed civilians, their movements in theater, or their health status, further hindering its efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. In August 2006, DOD issued a revised policy (to be effective in December 2006) that outlines procedures to address its lack of centralized deployment and health-related data. However, the procedures are not comprehensive enough to ensure that DOD will be sufficiently informed of the extent to which its components fully comply with its requirements to monitor the health of deployed federal civilians. The DOD components included in our review lacked documentation to show that they always implemented force health protection and surveillance requirements for deployed federal civilians. These requirements include completing (1) pre-deployment health assessments to ensure that only medically fit personnel deploy outside of the United States as part of a contingency or combat operation; (2) pre-deployment immunizations to address possible health threats in deployment locations; (3) pre-deployment medical screenings for tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); and (4) post-deployment health assessments to document current health status, experiences, environmental exposures, and health concerns related to their work while deployed. DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies require the components to assess the medical condition of federal civilians to ensure that only medically fit personnel deploy outside of the United States as part of a contingency or combat operation. The policies stipulate that all deploying civilian personnel are to complete pre-deployment health assessment forms within 30 days of their deployments, and health care providers are to review the assessments to confirm the civilians\u2019 health readiness status and identify any needs for additional clinical evaluations prior to their deployments. While the components that we included in our review had procedures in place that would enable them to implement DOD\u2019s pre-deployment health assessment policies, it was not clear to what extent they had done so. Our review of deployment records and other documentation at the selected component locations found that these components lacked documentation to show that some federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received the required pre-deployment health assessments. For those deployed federal civilians in our review, we found that, overall, a small number of deployment records (52 out of 3,771) were missing documentation to show that they had received their pre-deployment health assessments, as reflected in table 1. As shown in table 1, the federal civilian deployment records we included in our review showed wide variation by location regarding documentation of pre-deployment health assessments, ranging from less than 1 percent to more than 90 percent. On an aggregate component-level basis, at the Navy location in our review, we found that documentation was missing for 19 of the 52 records in our review. At the Air Force locations, documentation was missing for 29 of the 37 records in our review. In contrast, all three Army locations had hard copy or electronic records which indicated that almost all of their federal deployed civilians had received pre-deployment health assessments. In addition to completing pre-deployment health assessment forms, DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies stipulate that all DOD deploying federal civilians receive theater-specific immunizations to address possible health threats in deployment locations. Immunizations required for all civilian personnel who deploy to Afghanistan and Iraq include: hepatitis A (two-shot series); tetanus-diphtheria (within 10 years of deployment); smallpox (within 5 years of deployment); typhoid; and influenza (within the last 12 months of deployment). As reflected in table 2, based on the deployment records maintained by the components at locations included in our review, the overall number of federal civilian deployment records lacking documentation of only one of the required immunizations for deployment to Afghanistan and Iraq was 285 out of 3,771. However, 3,313 of the records we reviewed were missing documentation of two or more immunizations. At the Army\u2019s Fort Bliss, our review of its electronic deployment data determined that none of its deployed federal civilians had documentation to show that they had received immunizations. Officials at this location stated that they believed some immunizations had been given; however, they could not provide documentation as evidence of this. DOD policies require deploying federal civilians to receive certain screenings, such as for tuberculosis and HIV. Table 3 indicates that 55 of the 3,771 federal civilian deployment records included in our review were lacking documentation of the required tuberculosis screening; and approximately 35 were lacking documentation of HIV screenings prior to deployment. DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies also require returning DOD federal civilian personnel to undergo post-deployment health assessments to document current health status, experiences, environmental exposures, and health concerns related to their work while deployed. The post-deployment process begins within 5 days of civilians\u2019 redeployment from the theater to their home or demobilization processing stations. DOD\u2019s policies require civilian personnel to complete a post- deployment assessment that includes questions on health and exposure concerns. A health care provider is to review each assessment and recommend additional clinical evaluation or treatment as needed. As reflected in table 4, our review of deployment records at the selected component locations found that these components lacked documentation to show that most deployed federal civilians (3,525 out of 3,771) who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq had received the required post- deployment health assessments upon their return to the United States. Federal civilian deployment records lacking evidence of post-deployment health assessments ranged from 3 at the U.  Army Corps of Engineers Transatlantic Programs Center and Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, respectively, to 2,977 at Fort Bliss. Beyond the aforementioned weaknesses found in the selected components\u2019 implementation of force health protection and surveillance requirements for deploying federal civilians, as a larger issue, DOD lacks comprehensive, centralized data that would enable it to readily identify its deployed civilians, track their movements in theater, or monitor their health status, further hindering efforts to assess the overall effectiveness of its force health protection and surveillance capabilities. The Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC) is responsible for maintaining the department\u2019s centralized system that currently collects location-specific deployment information for military servicemembers, such as grid coordinates, latitude/longitude coordinates, or geographic location codes. However, DOD has not taken steps to similarly maintain centralized data on its deployed federal civilians. In addition, DOD had not provided guidance that would require its components to track and report data on the locations and movements of DOD federal civilian personnel in theaters of operations. In the absence of such a requirement, each DOD component collected and reported aggregated data that identified the total number of DOD federal civilian personnel in a theater of operations, but each lacked the ability to gather, analyze, and report information that could be used to specifically identify individuals at risk for occupational and environmental exposures during deployments. In previously reporting on the military services\u2019 implementation of DOD\u2019s force health protection and surveillance policies in 2003, we highlighted the importance of knowing the identity of servicemembers who deployed during a given operation and of tracking their movements within the theater of operations as major elements of a military medical surveillance system. We further noted the Institute of Medicine\u2019s finding that documentation on the location of units and individuals during a given deployment is important for epidemiological studies and appropriate medical care during and after deployments. The lack of such data may hamper DOD\u2019s ability to intervene in a timely manner to address health care problems that may arise from DOD federal civilian deployments to overseas locations in support of contingency operations. With increases in the department\u2019s use of federal civilian personnel to support military operations, DOD officials have recognized the need for more complete and centralized location-specific deployment information and deployment-related health information on its deployed federal civilians. These policies state that DOD federal civilians who require treatment for injuries or diseases sustained during overseas hostilities may be provided care under the DOD military health system. To obtain benefits under FECA, DOD federal civilians must show that (1) they were employed by the U.  government, (2) they were injured (exposed) in the workplace, (3) they have filed a claim in a timely manner, (4) they have a disabling medical condition, and (5) there is a causal link between their medical condition and the injury or exposure. Three avenues of appeal are provided for DOD federal civilians in the event that the initial claim is denied: (1) reconsideration by an OWCP claims examiner, (2) a hearing or review of the written record by OWCP\u2019s Branch of Hearings and Review, and (3) a review by the Employees\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board. Specifically, in reviewing a sample of seven workers\u2019 compensation claims (out of a universe of 83) filed under the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act by DOD federal civilians who deployed to Iraq, we found that in three cases where care was initiated in theater the affected federal civilians had received treatment in accordance with DOD\u2019s policies. Further, in all seven claims that we reviewed, DOD federal civilians who requested medical care after returning to the United States, had, in accordance with DOD\u2019s policy, received initial medical examinations and/or treatment for their deployment-related injuries or illnesses and diseases through either military or civilian treatment facilities. DOD provides a number of special pays and benefits to its federal civilian personnel who deploy in support of contingency operations, which are generally different in type and in amount from those provided to deployed military personnel. In our modeled scenarios, the overall amounts of compensation, which include special pays, were higher for DOD federal civilian personnel than for military personnel. DOD federal civilian personnel also receive different types and amounts of disability benefits, depending on specific program provisions and individual circumstances. Survivors of DOD federal civilian personnel, however, almost always receive lower noncash benefits than military personnel. In this context, DOD federal civilian personnel who are deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq are eligible to receive post (hardship) differential and danger pay, each equivalent to 35 percent of their base salaries. For example, to partially reimburse those who are involuntarily separated from their dependents, military personnel are eligible to receive a family separation allowance that is not available to deployed DOD federal civilian personnel. Additionally, unlike DOD federal civilian personnel, military personnel also receive a combat zone tax exclusion while deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq that excludes certain income from federal taxes. DOD federal civilian personnel, by contrast, are eligible for a variety of premium pays, such as overtime and night differential, that are not available to military personnel. Although DOD federal civilian and military personnel generally receive various special pays to compensate them for conditions of deployment, in certain scenarios that we modeled, the overall amounts of compensation payments were higher for DOD federal civilian personnel than for military personnel, as illustrated in tables 6 and 7. However, the payments to DOD federal civilian personnel are based on their salaries and whether the employee has any dependents, regardless of the number, which can vary significantly, whereas disability compensation payments made by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to injured military personnel are based on the severity of the injury and their number of dependents. DOD federal civilian personnel are eligible to receive continuation of pay (salary) for up to 45 days, followed by a recurring payment for wage loss which is based on a percentage of salary and whether they have any dependents, up to a cap. For DOD federal civilian personnel, these payments are provided for the remainder of life as long as the impairment persists, and can vary significantly depending upon the salary of the individual and the existence of dependents. DOD federal civilians with permanent partial disabilities receive a schedule of payments based on the specific type of impairment (sometimes referred to as a schedule award). Under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS), DOD federal civilian personnel must be unfit for duty and have 5 years of service to qualify for disability retirement benefits. DOD federal civilian personnel must elect either compensation benefits or disability retirement. DOD federal civilians with permanent disabilities receive a schedule award based on the specific type of impairment. In addition, DOD federal civilian personnel may be eligible for an additional attendant allowance\u2014up to $1,500 per month during 2006\u2014if such care is needed. DOD federal civilian personnel covered by FERS and military personnel pay into Social Security and thus may be eligible to receive SSDI benefits. However, DOD federal civilian personnel must choose between either compensation payments and SSDI benefits or have their disability retirement payments reduced when receiving SSDI benefits. Survivors of deceased federal civilian personnel receive a payment equal to the civilian\u2019s rate of basic pay, rounded to the nearest thousand, plus $2,000. DOD federal civilian employees also receive a survivor benefit in their retirement plans. For example, survivors of DOD federal civilian personnel may receive recurring payments from a retirement plan or workers\u2019 compensation if the death occurred while in the line of duty. Until DOD improves its oversight in this area, it will jeopardize its ability to be effectively informed of the extent to which its federal civilians are screened and deemed medically fit to deploy in support of contingency operations; deployed civilian personnel receive needed immunizations to counter theater disease threats; and what medical follow-up attention federal civilians require for health problems or concerns that may arise following their deployment. Specifically, the department stated that it has written and coordinated a new DOD instruction, scheduled to become effective before the end of 2006, that establishes a comprehensive DOD force health protection quality assurance program that will apply to DOD civilian personnel accompanying deploying military forces. To assess the extent to which DOD has established force health protection and surveillance policies for DOD federal civilians who deploy outside of the United States in support of contingency operations, and how the components (military services and the Defense Contract Management Agency) have implemented those policies, we reviewed pertinent force health protection and surveillance policies and discussed these policies with the following offices or commands: U.  Central Command; Joint Chiefs of Staff, Manpower and Personnel; Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness (including the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, Deployment Health Support Directorate; Civilian Personnel Policy; and Civilian Personnel Management Services); the Surgeons General for the Army, Navy, and Air Force; and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). Our review focused on DOD federal civilians who (1) deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq for 30 continuous days or more between June 1, 2003, and September 30, 2005, and (2) returned to the United States by February 28, 2006. For these components, we selected five locations based on data that indicated that these locations had deployed the largest numbers of federal civilian personnel. DCMA was included in our review because it had deployed the largest number of federal civilian personnel compared to other defense agencies. At all eight component locations, we reviewed either all available hard copy or electronic deployment records, or in one instance, a sample of the deployment records for deployed federal civilian personnel who met our criteria above. In total, we reviewed 3,431 hard copy and automated records for federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq. To facilitate our review of federal civilian deployment records at the selected component locations, we developed a data collection instrument to review and collect deployment health information from each individual civilian\u2019s deployment record. Our study population was limited to DOD federal civilians who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. We did not find these deployment and health data to be sufficiently reliable for (1) identifying the universe of DOD federal civilian deployments or (2) use as the sole source for reviewing the health and immunization information for all DOD federal civilian deployments, but we found the information systems to be sufficiently reliable when used as one of several sources in our review of deployment records. To determine the extent to which DOD has established and the components have implemented medical treatment policies for DOD federal civilians who deployed in support of contingency operations, we examined pertinent medical treatment policies for DOD federal civilian employees who required treatment for injuries and diseases sustained while supporting contingency operations. In addition, we obtained workers\u2019 compensation claims filed by DOD federal civilian personnel with the Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs(OWCP) showing those civilians who sustained injuries and diseases during deployment. To identify special pays and benefits provided to DOD federal civilians who deployed in support of contingency operations and to assess the extent that special pays and benefits differ from those provided to deployed active duty military personnel, we examined major statutory provisions for special pays, disability and death benefits for federal civilians and military personnel, including relevant chapters of Title 5 of the U.  Code governing federal civilian personnel management; relevant chapters of Title 10 of the U.  Code governing armed forces personnel management; Section 112 of Title 26 of the U.  Code governing combat zone tax exemption; relevant chapters of Title 37 of the U.  Code governing pay and allowances for the uniformed services; relevant chapters of Title 38 of the U.  Code governing veterans\u2019 benefits; relevant provisions of applicable public laws governing military and civilian pay and benefits; applicable directives and instructions related to active duty military and DOD federal civilian benefits and entitlements; DOD financial management regulations; Department of State regulations; and prior GAO reports. We did not perform a comprehensive review of all compensation\u2014comprised of a myriad of pays and benefits\u2014offered to active duty military and federal civilian personnel in general. After reviewing documents and interviewing officials, we then compiled and analyzed the information on the types and amounts of special pays and benefits available to active duty military and DOD federal civilian personnel who deployed to Afghanistan or Iraq. Through discussions with senior DOD officials, we made an assumption that deployed DOD federal civilians worked 30 hours of overtime per week. For deployed DOD federal civilians, we subtracted a contribution of $15,000 to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) to obtain the adjusted gross income. We assumed that DOD federal civilians, temporarily at a higher tax bracket, would take maximum advantage of the opportunity to defer taxes. As table 13 shows, DOD federal civilians who are injured in the line of duty are eligible to receive continuation of their salary up to 45 days, followed by a recurring payment for wage loss that is based on a percentage of their salary and the existence of dependents, up to a cap. As table 14 shows, DOD federal civilian personnel with permanent partial disabilities receive payments based on salary and dependents while military personnel receive payments based on the severity of the injury and their number of dependents, as long as the condition persists.

(No major country has a pure territorial system; they all tax mobile forms of foreign-source income, such as royalties and income from securities.) The current U.S. tax system has some features that result in some cases in treatment similar to what would exist under a territorial system. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. Second, in certain cases U.S. corporations are able to use the excess credits that they earned for taxes they paid to high-tax countries to completely offset any U.S. tax that they would normally have to pay on income they earned in low-tax countries. As a result, that income from low-tax countries remains untaxed by the United States\u2014just as it would be under a territorial system. In fact, there are some cases where U.S. corporations enjoy tax treatment that is more favorable than under a territorial system. This occurs when they pay no U.S. tax on foreign-source income yet are still able to deduct expenses allocable to that income. For example, a U.S. parent corporation can borrow money and invest it in a foreign subsidiary. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. Proponents of a worldwide tax system and proponents of a territorial system both argue that their preferred systems would provide important forms of tax neutrality. Under a pure worldwide system all of the income that a U.S. corporation earns abroad would be taxed at the same effective rate that a corporation earning the same amount of income domestically would pay. Such a tax system is neutral in the sense that it does not influence the decision of U.S. corporations to invest abroad or at home. If the U.S. had a pure territorial tax system all of the income that U.S. corporations earn in a particular country would be taxed at the same rate as corporations that are residents of that country. The pure territorial system is neutral in the specific sense that U.S. corporations investing in a foreign country would not be at a disadvantage relative to corporations residing in that country or relative to other foreign corporations investing there. In a world where each country sets its own tax rules it is impossible to achieve both types of neutrality at the same time, so tradeoffs are unavoidable. A change from the current tax system to a pure territorial one is likely to have mixed effects on tax compliance and administration. On the one hand, a pure worldwide tax system, or even the current system, may preserve the U.S. tax base better than a territorial system would because U.S. taxpayers would have greater incentive under a territorial system to shift income and investment into low-tax jurisdictions via transfer pricing. On the other hand, a pure territorial system may be less complex for IRS to administer and for taxpayers to comply with than the current tax system because there would be no need for the antideferral rules or the foreign tax credit, which are among the most complex features of the current system. Broad-based consumption taxes can differ depending on whether they are imposed under a destination principle, which holds that goods and services should be taxed in the countries where they are consumed, or an origin principle, which holds that goods and services should be taxed in the countries where they are produced. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. This is true for a destination-based tax because products consumed in the United States would be taxed at the same rate, regardless of where they were produced. Therefore, such a tax would not influence a consumer\u2019s choice between buying a car produced in the United States or one imported from Japan. And at the same time, U.S. exports of cars would not be affected by the tax because they would be exempted. An origin-based consumption tax would not affect the trade balance because the tax effects that taxes have on prices would ultimately be countered by the same price adjustment mechanism that we discussed earlier with respect to targeted tax subsidies for exports. A national retail sales tax limited to final consumption goods would be a destination-principle tax; it would tax imports when sold at retail in this country and would not tax exports. Value-added taxes can be designed as either destination or origin-principle taxes. A personal consumption tax, collected at the individual level, would apply to U.S. residents or citizens and could be formulated to tax their consumption regardless of whether it is done domestically or overseas. Under such a system, income earned abroad would be taxable but funds saved or invested abroad would be deductible. In that case, foreign- produced goods imported into the United States or consumed by U.S. citizens abroad would be taxed. U.S. exports would only be taxed to the extent that they are consumed by U.S. citizens abroad. A wide range of options exist for moving from the current business tax system to an alternative one, and the way that any transition is formulated could have significant effects for economic efficiency, equity, taxpayer compliance burden, and tax administration. For example, one transition issue involves whether tax credits and other tax benefits already earned under the current tax would be made available under a new system. Businesses that are deducting depreciation under the current system would not have the opportunity to continue depreciating their capital goods under a VAT unless special rules were included to permit it. Similar problems could arise with businesses\u2019 carrying forward net operating losses and recovering unclaimed tax credits. Depending on how these and other issues are addressed, taxpayer compliance burden and tax administration responsibilities could be greater during the transition period than they currently are or than they would be once the transition ends. Transition rules could also substantially reduce the new system\u2019s tax base, thereby requiring higher tax rates during the transition if revenue neutrality were to be achieved. Our publication, Understanding the Tax Reform Debate: Background, Criteria, and Questions, may be useful in guiding policymakers as they consider tax reform proposals. It was designed to aid policymakers in thinking about how to develop tax policy for the 21st century. <mask_1>. And, as I also noted earlier, proposals for reforming business taxation cannot be evaluated without considering how that business taxation will interact with and complement the other elements of our overall future tax system. The proposed system should raise sufficient revenue over time to fund our expected expenditures. As I mentioned earlier, we will fall woefully short of achieving this end if current spending or revenue trends are not altered. Although we clearly must restructure major entitlement programs and the basis of other federal spending, it is unlikely that our long-term fiscal challenge will be resolved solely by cutting spending. The proposal should look to future needs. Like many spending programs, the current tax system was developed in a profoundly different time. We live now in a much more global economy, with highly mobile capital, and with investment options available to ordinary citizens that were not even imagined decades ago. We have growing concentrations of income and wealth. More firms operate multinationally and willingly move operations and capital around the world as they see best for their firms. As an adjunct to looking forward when making reforms, better information on existing commitments and promises must be coupled with estimates of the long-term discounted net present value costs from spending and tax commitments comprising longer-term exposures for the federal budget beyond the existing 10-year budget projection window. The tax base should be as broad as possible. Broad-based tax systems with minimal exceptions have many advantages. Fewer exceptions generally means less complexity, less compliance cost, less economic efficiency loss, and by increasing transparency may improve equity or perceptions of equity. This suggests that eliminating or consolidating numerous tax expenditures must be considered. In many cases tax preferences are simply a form of \u201cback-door spending.\u201d We need to be sure that the benefits achieved from having these special provisions are worth the associated revenue losses just as we must ensure that outlay programs\u2014 which may be attempting to achieve the same purposes as tax expenditures\u2014achieve outcomes commensurate with their costs. And it is important to supplement these cost-benefit evaluations with analyses of distributional effects\u2014i.e., who bears the costs of the preferences and who receives the benefits. To the extent tax expenditures are retained, consideration should be given to whether they could be better targeted to meet an identified need. If we must raise revenues, doing so from a broad base and a lower rate will help minimize economic efficiency costs. Broad-based tax systems can yield the same revenue as more narrowly based systems at lower tax rates. The combination of less direct intervention in the marketplace from special tax preferences, and the lower rates possible from broad-based systems, can have substantial benefits for economic efficiency. For instance, one commonly cited rule of thumb regarding economic efficiency costs of tax increases is that they rise proportionately faster than the tax rates. In other words, a 10 percent tax increase could raise the economic efficiency costs of a tax system by much more than 10 percent. Aside from the base-broadening that minimizes targeted tax preferences favoring specific types of investment or other business behavior, it is also desirable on the grounds of economic efficiency to extend the principle of tax neutrality to the broader structural features of a business tax system. For example, improvements in economic efficiency can also be gained by avoiding differences in tax treatment, such as the differences in the current system based on legal form of organization, source of financing, and the nature and location of foreign operations. Removing such differences can shift resources to more productive uses, increasing economic performance and the standard of living of Americans. Shifting resources to more productive uses can result in a step up in the level of economic activity which would be measured as a one-time increase in the rate of growth. Tax changes that increase efficiency can also increase the long-term rate of economic growth if they increase the rate of technological change; however, not all efficiency-increasing tax changes will do so. Impact on the standard of living of Americans is also a useful criterion for evaluating policies to improve U.S. competitiveness. As was discussed earlier, narrower goals and policies, such as increasing the U.S. balance of trade through targeted tax breaks aimed at encouraging exports, are generally viewed as ineffective by economists. What determines the standard of living of Americans and how it compares to the standard of living in other countries is the productivity of American workers and capital. That productivity is determined by factors such as education, technological innovation, and the amount of investment in the U.S. economy. Tax policy can contribute to American productivity in several ways. One, discussed in this statement, is through neutral taxation of investment alternatives. Another, which I have discussed on many occasions, is through fiscal policy. Borrowing to finance persistent federal deficits absorbs savings from the private sector reducing funds available for investment. Higher saving and investment from a more balanced fiscal policy would contribute to increased productivity and a higher standard of living for Americans over the long term. A reformed business tax system should have attributes associated with high compliance rates. Because any tax system can be subject to tax gaps, the administrability of reformed systems should be considered as part of the debate for change. In general, a reformed system is most likely to have a small tax gap if the system has few tax preferences or complex provisions and taxable transactions are transparent. Transparency in the context of tax administration is best achieved when third parties report information both to the taxpayer and the tax administrator. Minimizing tax code complexity has the potential to reduce noncompliance for at least three broad reasons. First, it could help taxpayers to comply voluntarily with more certainty, reducing inadvertent errors by those who want to comply but are confused because of complexity. Second, it may limit opportunities for tax evasion, reducing intentional noncompliance by taxpayers who can misuse the complex code provisions to hide their noncompliance or to achieve ends through tax shelters. Third, reducing tax-code complexity could improve taxpayers\u2019 willingness to comply voluntarily. Finally, the consideration of transition rules needs to be an integral part of the design of a new system. The effects of these rules can be too significant to leave them simply as an afterthought in the reform process. The problems that I have reviewed today relating to the compliance costs, efficiency costs, equity, and tax gap associated with the current business tax system would seem to make a strong case for a comprehensive review and reform of our tax policy. Further, businesses operate in a world that is profoundly different\u2014more competitive and more global\u2014than when many of the existing provisions of the tax code were adopted. Despite numerous and repeated calls for reform, progress has been slow. I discussed reasons for the slow progress in a previous hearing on individual tax reform before this committee. One reason why reform is difficult to accomplish is that the provisions of the tax code that generate compliance costs, efficiency costs, the tax gap and inequities also benefit many taxpayers. Reform is also difficult because, even when there is agreement on the amount of revenue to raise, there are differing opinions on the appropriate balance among the often conflicting objectives of equity, efficiency, and administrability. This, in turn, leads to widely divergent views on even the basic direction of reform. <mask_1>. One of them is revenue sufficiency. Fiscal necessity, prompted by the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path, will eventually force changes to our spending and tax policies. We must fundamentally rethink policies and everything must be on the table. Tough choices will have to be made about the appropriate degree of emphasis on cutting back federal programs versus increasing tax revenue. Other principles, such as broadening the tax base and otherwise promoting tax neutrality, could help improve economic performance. While economic growth alone will not solve our long-term fiscal problems, an improvement in our overall economic performance makes dealing with those problems easier. The recent report of the President\u2019s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform recommended two different tax reform plans. Although each plan is intended to improve economic efficiency and simplify the tax system, neither of them addresses the growing imbalance between federal spending and revenues that I have highlighted. One approach for getting the process of comprehensive fiscal reform started would be through the establishment of a credible, capable, and bipartisan commission, to examine options for a combination of selected entitlement and tax reform issues. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have at this time.

Over the past decade, several proposals for fundamental tax reform have been put forward. <mask_1>. Some of the proposals would replace the federal income tax with some type of consumption tax levied only on businesses. Consumption taxes levied only on businesses include retail sales taxes (RST) and value-added taxes (VAT). The flat tax would also change the tax base to consumption but include both a relatively simple individual tax along with a business tax. A personal consumption tax, a consumption tax levied primarily on individuals, has also been proposed. Similar changes in the level at which taxes are collected could be made while retaining an income tax base. This appendix provides a brief description of several of these proposals. The consumption tax that Americans are most familiar with is the retail sales tax, which in many states, is levied when goods or services are purchased at the retail level. <mask_1>. In contrast to an income tax, then, income that is saved is not taxed until it is used for consumption. Under a national RST, different tax rates could be applied to different goods, and the sale of some goods could carry a zero tax rate (exemption). However, directly taxing different individuals at different rates for the same good would be very difficult. A consumption VAT, which like the RST, is a business-level consumption tax levied directly on the purchase of goods and services. The two taxes differ in the manner in which the tax is collected and paid. In contrast to a retail sales tax, sales of goods and services to consumers and to businesses are taxable under a VAT. <mask_1>. Under either method, sales between businesses do not generate net tax liability under a VAT because the amount included in the tax base by businesses selling goods is equal to the amount deducted by the business purchasing goods. The only sales that generate net revenue for the government are sales between businesses and consumers, which is the same case as the RST. An income VAT would move the taxation of wage income to the business level as well. No individual returns would be necessary, so the burden of complying with the tax law would be eliminated for individuals. <mask_1>. Calculations would not have to be made for different individuals, which would simplify tax administration and compliance burdens but not allow for treating different individuals differently. The flat tax was developed in the early 1980s by economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka. The Hall-Rabushka flat tax proposal includes both an individual tax and a business tax. As described by Hall and Rabushka, the flat tax is a modification of a VAT; the modifications make the tax more progressive (less regressive) than a VAT. In particular, the business tax base is designed to be the same as that of a VAT, except that businesses are allowed to deduct wages and retirement income paid out as well as purchases from other businesses. Wage and retirement income is then taxed when received by individuals at the same rate as the business tax rate. By including this individual-level tax as well as the business tax, standard deductions can be made available to individuals. Individuals with less wage and retirement income than the standard deduction amounts would not owe any tax. A personal consumption tax would look much like a personal income tax. The major difference between the two is that under the consumption tax, taxpayers would include all income received, amounts borrowed, and cash flows received from the sale of assets, and then deduct the amount they saved. The remaining amount would be a measure of the taxpayer\u2019s consumption over the year. When funds are withdrawn from bank accounts, or stocks or bonds are sold, both the original amount saved and interest earned are taxable because they are available for consumption. If withdrawn funds are reinvested in another qualified account or in stock or bonds, the taxable amount of the withdrawal would be offset by the deduction for the same amount that is reinvested. While the personal consumption tax would look like a personal income tax, the tax base would be the same as an RST. <mask_1>. Because it is an individual-level tax, different tax rates could be applied to different individuals so that the tax could be made more progressive, and other taxpayer characteristics, such as family size, could be taken into account if desired.

Most income derived from private sector business activity in the United States is subject to federal corporate income tax, the individual income tax, or both. S. The tax treatment that applies to a business depends on its legal form of organization. Firms that are organized under the tax code as \u201cC\u201d corporations (which include most large, publicly held corporations) have their profits taxed once at the entity level under the corporate income tax (on a form 1120) and then a second time under the individual income tax when profits are transferred to individual shareholders in the form of dividends or realized capital gains. Firms that are organized as \u201cpass-through\u201d entities, such as partnerships, limited liability companies, and \u201cS\u201d corporations are generally not taxed at the entity level; however, their net incomes are passed through each year and taxed in the hands of their partners or shareholders under the individual income tax (as part of those taxpayers\u2019 form 1040 filing).  taxpayers. Similarly, income from businesses that are owned by single individuals enters into the taxable incomes of those owners under the individual income tax and is not subject to a separate entity-level tax. The base of the federal corporate income tax includes net income from business operations (receipts, minus the costs of purchased goods, labor, interest, and other expenses). It also includes net income that corporations earn in the form of interest, dividends, rent, royalties, and realized capital gains. The statutory rate of tax on net corporate income ranges from 15 to 35 percent, depending on the amount of income earned. The United States taxes the worldwide income of domestic corporations, regardless of where the income is earned, with a foreign tax credit for certain taxes paid to other countries. However, the timing of the tax liability depends on several factors, including whether the income is from a U.  or foreign source and, if it is from a foreign source, whether it is earned through direct operations or through a subsidiary. The base of the individual income tax covers business-source income paid to individuals, such as dividends, realized net capital gains on corporate equity, and income from self-employment. The statutory rates of tax on net taxable income range from 10 percent to 35 percent. Lower rates (generally 5 percent and 15 percent, depending on taxable income) apply to long-term capital gains and dividend income. Sole proprietors also pay both the employer and employee shares of social insurance taxes on their net business income. Generally, a U.  citizen or resident pays tax on his or her worldwide income, including income derived from foreign-source dividends and capital gains subject to a credit for foreign taxes paid on such income. Three long-standing criteria\u2014economic efficiency, equity, and a combination of simplicity, transparency and administrability\u2014are typically used to evaluate tax policy. These criteria are often in conflict with each other, and as a result, there are usually trade-offs to consider and people are likely to disagree about the relative importance of the criteria. Specific aspects of business taxes can be evaluated in terms of how they support or detract from the efficiency, equity, simplicity, transparency, and administrability of the overall tax system. To the extent that a tax system is not simple and efficient, it imposes costs on taxpayers beyond the payments they make to the U.  Treasury. As shown in figure 1, the total cost of any tax from a taxpayer\u2019s point of view is the sum of the tax liability, the cost of complying with the tax system, and the economic efficiency costs that the tax imposes. In deciding on the size of government, we balance the total cost of taxes with the benefits provided by government programs. A complete evaluation of the tax treatment of businesses, which is a critical element of our overall federal tax system, cannot be made without considering how business taxation interacts with and complements the other elements of the overall system, such as the tax treatment of individuals and excise taxes on selected goods and services. This integrated approach is also appropriate for evaluating reform alternatives, regardless of whether those alternatives take the form of a simplified income tax system, a consumption tax system, or some combination of the two. Businesses contribute significant revenues to the federal government, both directly and indirectly. As figure 2 shows, corporate businesses paid $278 billion in corporate income tax directly to the federal government in 2005. Individuals earn income from business investment in the form of dividends and realized capital gains from C corporations; income allocations from partnerships and S corporations; entrepreneurial income from their own sole proprietorships; and rents and royalties. In recent years this business- source income, which is all taxed under the individual income tax, has amounted to between roughly 14 percent and 19 percent of the income of individuals who have paid individual income tax. In addition to the taxes that are paid on business-source income, most of the remainder of federal taxes is collected and passed on to the government by businesses. Business tax revenues of the magnitude discussed make them very relevant to considerations about how to address the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal imbalance. Over the long term, the United States faces a large and growing structural budget deficit primarily caused by demographic trends and rising health care costs as shown in figure 3, and exacerbated over time by growing interest on the ever-larger federal debt. Continuing on this imprudent and unsustainable fiscal path will gradually erode, if not suddenly damage, our economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national security. We cannot grow our way out of this long-term fiscal challenge because the imbalance between spending and revenue is so large. We will need to make tough choices using a multipronged approach: (1) revise budget processes and financial reporting requirements; (2) restructure entitlement programs; (3) reexamine the base of discretionary spending and other spending; and (4) review and revise tax policy, including tax expenditures, and tax enforcement programs. Business tax policy, business tax expenditures, and business tax enforcement need to be part of the overall tax review because of the amount of revenue at stake. Business tax expenditures reduce the revenue that would otherwise be raised from businesses. As already noted, to reduce their tax liabilities, businesses can take advantage of preferential provisions in the tax code, such as exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, preferential rates, and deferral of tax liability. Tax preferences\u2014which are legally known as tax expenditures\u2014are often aimed at policy goals similar to those of federal spending programs. For example, there are different tax expenditures intended to encourage economic development in disadvantaged areas and stimulate research and development, while there are also federal spending programs that have similar purposes. Also, by narrowing the tax base, business tax expenditures have the effect of raising either business tax rates or the rates on other taxpayers in order to generate a given amount of revenue. The design of the current system of business taxation causes economic inefficiency and is complex. The complexity provides fertile ground for noncompliance and raises equity concerns. Our current system for taxing business income causes economic inefficiency because it imposes significantly different effective rates of tax on different types of investments. Tax treatment that is not neutral across different types of capital investment causes significant economic inefficiency by guiding investments to lightly taxed activities rather than those with high pretax productivity. However, the goal of tax policy is not to eliminate efficiency costs. The goal is to design a tax system that produces a desired amount of revenue and balances economic efficiency with other objectives, such as equity, simplicity, transparency, and administrability. Every practical tax system imposes efficiency costs. There are some features of current business taxation that have attracted criticism by economists and other tax experts because of efficiency costs. My point in raising them here is not that these features need to be changed\u2014that is a policy judgment for Congress to make as it balances various goals. Rather, my point is that these economic consequences of tax policy need to be considered as we think about reform. The following are among the most noted cases of nonneutral taxation in the federal business tax system: Income earned on equity-financed investments made by C corporations is taxed twice\u2014under both the corporate and individual income taxes, whereas no other business income is taxed more than once. Moreover, even noncorporate business investment is taxed more heavily than owner-occupied housing\u2014a form of capital investment that receives very preferential treatment. As a result, resources have been shifted away from higher-return business investment into owner-occupied housing, and, within the business sector, resources have been shifted from higher-return corporations to noncorporate businesses. Such shifting of investment makes workers less productive than they would be under a more neutral tax system. This results in employees receiving lower wages because increases in employee wages are generally tied to increases in productivity. As noted above, such efficiency costs may be worth paying in order to meet other policy goals. For example, many policymakers advocate increased homeownership as a social policy goal. Depreciation allowances under the tax code vary considerably in generosity across different assets causing effective tax rates to vary and, thereby, favoring investment in certain assets over others. For example, researchers have found that the returns on most types of investments in equipment are taxed more favorably than are most investments in nonresidential buildings. These biases shift resources away from some investments in buildings that would have been more productive than some of the equipment investments that are being made instead. Tax rules for corporations favor the use of debt over shareholder equity as a source of finance for investment. The return on debt- financed investment consists of interest payments to the corporation\u2019s creditors, which are deductible by the corporations. Consequently, that return is taxed only once\u2014in the hands of the creditors. In contrast, the return on equity-financed investment consists of dividends and capital gains, which are not deductible by the corporation. These forms of income that are taxed under the individual tax are paid out of income that has already been subject to the corporate income tax. The bias against equity finance induces corporations to have less of an \u201cequity cushion\u201d against business downturns. Capital gains on corporate equity are taxed more favorably than dividends because that tax can be deferred until the gains are realized (typically when shareholders sell their stock). This bias against dividend payments likely means that more profits are retained within corporations than otherwise would be the case and, therefore, the flow of capital to its most productive uses is being constrained. The complex set of rules governing U.  taxation of the worldwide income of domestic corporations (those incorporated in the United States) leads to wide variations in the effective rate of tax paid on that income, based on the nature and location of each corporation\u2019s foreign operations and the effort put into tax planning. In effect, the active foreign income of some U.  corporations is taxed more heavily than if the United States followed the practice of many other countries and exempted such income from tax. However, other U.  corporations are able to take advantage of flexibilities in the U.  tax rules in order to achieve treatment that is equivalent to or, in some cases, more favorable than the so-called \u201cterritorial\u201d tax systems that exempt foreign-source active business income. As a consequence, some U.  corporations face a tax disadvantage, while others have an advantage, relative to foreign corporations when competing in foreign countries. Those U.  corporations that have a disadvantage are likely to locate a smaller share of their investment overseas than would be the case in a tax-free world; the opposite is true for those U.  corporations with the tax advantage. Moreover, the tax system encourages U.  corporations to alter their cash-management and financing decisions (such as by delaying the repatriation of profits) in order to reduce their taxes. The taxation of business income is part of the broader taxation of income from capital. The taxation of capital income in general (even when that taxation is uniformly applied) causes another form of inefficiency beyond the inefficiencies caused by the aforementioned cases of differential taxation across types of investments. This additional inefficiency occurs because taxes on capital reduce the after-tax return on savings and, thereby, distort the choice that individuals make between current consumption and saving for future consumption. However, although research shows that the demand for some types of savings, such as the demand for tax exempt bonds, is responsive to tax changes, there is greater uncertainty about the effects of tax changes on other choices, such as aggregate savings. Sometimes the concerns about the negative effects of taxation on the U.  economy are couched in terms of \u201ccompetitiveness,\u201d where the vaguely defined term competitiveness is often defined as the ability of U.  businesses to export their products to foreign markets and to compete against foreign imports into the U.  market. The goal of those who push for this type of competitiveness is to improve the U.  balance of trade. However, economists generally agree that trying to increase the U.  balance of trade through targeted tax breaks for exports does not work. Such a policy, aimed at lowering the prices of exports, would be offset by an increase in the value of the dollar which would make U.  exports more expensive and imports into the Unites States less expensive, ultimately leaving both the balance of trade and the standard of living of Americans unchanged. An alternative definition of competitiveness that is also sometimes used in tax policy debates refers to the ability of U. -owned firms operating abroad to compete in foreign markets. The current U.  policy of taxing the worldwide income of U.  businesses places some of their foreign operations at a disadvantage. The tradeoffs between a worldwide system and a territorial tax system are discussed below. Tax compliance requirements for businesses are extensive and complex. Rules governing the computation of taxable income, expense deductions, and tax credits of U.  corporations that do business in multiple foreign countries are particularly complex. But even small businesses face multiple levels of tax requirements of varying difficulty. In addition to computing and documenting their income, expenses, and qualifications for various tax credits, businesses with employees are responsible for collecting and remitting (at varying intervals) several federal taxes on the incomes of those employees. Moreover, if the businesses choose to offer their employees retirement plans and other fringe benefits, they can substantially increase the number of filings they must make. Businesses also have information-reporting responsibilities\u2014employers send wage statements to their employees and to IRS; banks and other financial intermediaries send investment income statements to clients and to IRS. Finally, a relatively small percentage of all businesses (which nevertheless number in the hundreds of thousands) are required to participate in the collection of various federal excise taxes levied on fuels, heavy trucks and trailers, communications, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, among other products. It is difficult for researchers to accurately estimate compliance costs for the tax system as a whole or for particular types of taxpayers because taxpayers generally do not keep records of the time and money spent complying with tax requirements. Studies we found that focus on the compliance costs of businesses estimate them to be between about $40 billion and $85 billion per year. None of these estimates include the costs to businesses of collecting and remitting income and payroll taxes for their employees. The accuracy of these business compliance cost estimates is uncertain due to the low rates of response to their data-collection surveys. In addition, the range in estimates across the studies is due, among other things, to differences in monetary values used (ranging between $25 per hour and $37. 26 per hour), differences in the business populations covered, and differences in the tax years covered. Although the precise amount of business tax avoidance is unknown, IRS\u2019s latest estimates of tax compliance show a tax gap of at least $141 billion for tax year 2001 between the business taxes that individual and corporate taxpayers paid and what they should have paid under the law. Corporations contributed about $32 billion to the tax gap by underreporting about $30 billion in taxes on tax returns and failing to pay about $2 billion in taxes that were reported on returns. Individual taxpayers that underreported their business income accounted for the remaining $109 billion of the business income tax gap. A complex tax code, complicated business transactions, and often multinational corporate structures make determining business tax liabilities and the extent of corporate tax avoidance a challenge. Tax avoidance has become such a concern that some tax experts say corporate tax departments have become \u201cprofit centers\u201d as corporations seek to take advantage of the tax laws in order to maximize shareholder value. Some corporate tax avoidance is clearly legal, some falls in gray areas of the tax code, and some is clearly noncompliance or illegal, as shown by IRS\u2019s tax gap estimate. Often business tax avoidance is legal. For example, multinational corporations can locate active trade or business operations in jurisdictions that have lower effective tax rates than does the United States and, unless and until they repatriate the income, defer taxation in the United States on that income, thus reducing their effective tax rate. In addition, investors can avoid paying the corporate income tax by putting their money into unincorporated businesses or into real estate. Complicating corporate tax compliance is the fact that in many cases the law is unclear or subject to differing interpretations. In fact, some have postulated that major corporations\u2019 tax returns are actually just the opening bid in an extended negotiation with IRS to determine a corporation\u2019s tax liability. An illustration\u2014once again from the complex area of international tax rules\u2014is transfer pricing. Transfer pricing involves setting the appropriate price for such things as goods, services, or intangible property (such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, technology, or \u201cknow-how\u201d) that is transferred between the U. -based operations of a multinational company and a foreign affiliate. If the price paid by the affiliate to the U.  operation is understated, the profits of the U.  operation are reduced and U.  taxable income is inappropriately reduced or eliminated. The standard for judging the correct price is the price that would have been paid between independent enterprises acting at \u201carm\u2019s length. Given the global economy and the number of multinational firms with some U. -based operations, opportunities for transfer pricing disputes are likely to grow. Tax shelters are one example of how tax avoidance, including corporate tax avoidance, can shade into the illegal. Some tax shelters are legal though perhaps aggressive interpretations of the law, but others cross the line. Abusive shelters often are complex transactions that manipulate many parts of the tax code or regulations and are typically buried among legitimate transactions reported on tax returns. Because these transactions are often composed of many pieces located in several parts of a complex tax return, they are essentially hidden from plain sight, which contributes to the difficulty of determining the scope of the abusive shelter problem. Often lacking economic substance or a business purpose other than generating tax benefits, abusive shelters have been promoted by some tax professionals, often in confidence, for significant fees, sometimes with the participation of tax-indifferent parties, such as foreign or tax-exempt entities. These shelters may involve unnecessary steps and flow-through entities, such as partnerships, which make detection of these transactions more difficult. Regarding compliance with our tax laws, the success of our tax system hinges greatly on individual and business taxpayers\u2019 perception of its fairness and understandability. Compliance is influenced not only by the effectiveness of IRS\u2019s enforcement efforts but also by Americans\u2019 attitudes about the tax system and their government. A recent survey indicated that about 10 percent of respondents say it is acceptable to cheat on their taxes. Furthermore, the complexity of, and frequent revisions to, the tax system make it more difficult and costly for taxpayers who want to comply to do so and for IRS to explain and enforce tax laws. The lack of transparency also fuels disrespect for the tax system and the government. Thus, a crucial challenge in evaluating our business tax system will be to determine how we can best strengthen enforcement of existing laws to give businesses owners confidence that their competitors are paying their fair share and to give wage earners confidence that businesses in general bear their share of taxes. One option that has been suggested as a means of improving public confidence in the tax system\u2019s fairness is to make the reconciliation between book and tax income that businesses present on schedule M-3 of their tax returns available for public review. Reform of our business tax system will necessarily mean making broad design choices about the overall tax system and how business taxes are coordinated with other taxes. The tax reform debate of the last several years has focused attention on several important choices, including the extent to which our system should be closer to the extreme of a pure income tax or the other extreme of a pure consumption tax, the extent to which sales by U.  businesses outside of this country should be taxed, the extent to which taxes should be collected from businesses or individuals, and the extent to which taxpayers are compensated for losses or costs they incur during the transition to any new tax system. Generally there is no single \u201cright\u201d decision about these choices and the options are not limited to selecting a system that is at one extreme or the other along the continuum of potential systems. The choices will involve making tradeoffs between the various goals for our tax system. The fundamental difference between income and consumption taxes lies in their treatment of savings and investment. Income can be used for either consumption or saving and investment. The tax base of a pure income tax includes all income, regardless of what it is ultimately used for; in contrast, the tax base of a consumption tax excludes income devoted to saving and investment (until it is ultimately used for consumption). The current tax system is a hybrid between a pure income tax and a pure consumption tax because it effectively exempts some types of savings and investment but taxes other types. As noted earlier, evidence is inconclusive regarding whether a shift closer to a consumption tax base would significantly affect the level of savings by U. There is, however, a consensus among economists that uneven tax treatment across different types of investment should be avoided unless the efficiency costs resulting from preferential tax treatment are outweighed by the social benefits generated by the tax preference. That objective could be achieved under either a consumption tax that exempts all new savings and investment from taxation (which means that all business profits are exempt) or a revised income tax that taxed all investments at the same effective rate. In comparison to the current system, a consumption tax\u2019s exemption of business-source income would likely encourage U.  businesses to increase their investment in the United States relative to their foreign investment. Both income and consumption taxes can be structured in a variety of ways, as discussed in the following subsections, and the choice of a specific design for either type of tax can have as significant implications for efficiency, administrability, and equity as the choice between a consumption or income base. The exemption of saving and investment can be accomplished in different ways, so consumption taxes can be structured differently and yet still have the same overall tax base. Both income and consumption taxes can be levied on individuals or businesses, or on a combination of the two. Whether collected from individuals or businesses, ultimately, individuals will bear the economic burden of any tax (as wage earners, shareholders, or consumers). The choice of whether to collect a tax at the business level or the individual level depends on whether it is thought to be desirable to levy different taxes on different individuals. A business-level tax, whether levied on income or consumption, can be collected \u201cat source\u201d\u2014that is, where it is generated\u2014so there can be many fewer tax filers and returns to administer. Business-level taxes cannot, however, directly tax different individuals at different rates. Individual-level taxes can allow for distinctions between different individuals; for example, standard deductions or graduated rates can be used to tax individuals with low income (or consumption) at a lower rate than individuals with greater income (or consumption). However, individual-level taxes require more tax returns, impose higher compliance costs, and would generally require a larger tax administration system. A national retail sales tax, a consumption value-added tax, and an income value-added tax are examples of taxes that would be collected only at the business level. A personal consumption tax and an integrated individual income tax are examples of taxes that would be collected only at the individual level. The \u201cflat tax\u201d proposed by economists Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka that has received attention in recent years is an example of a tax collected at both the business and individual level. Our current system for taxing corporate-source income involves taxation at both the corporate and individual level in a manner that results in the double taxation of the same income. Under a pure worldwide tax system the United States would tax the income of U.  corporations, as it is earned, regardless of where it is earned, and at the same time provide a foreign tax credit that ensures that the combined rate of tax that a corporation pays to all governments on each dollar of income is exactly equal to the U.  corporate tax rate. Some basic differences between the current U.  tax system and a pure worldwide system are that (1) in many cases the U.  system permits corporations to defer U.  tax on their foreign-source income until it is repatriated and (2) the U.  foreign tax credit is limited to the amount of U.  tax that would be due on a corporation\u2019s foreign-source income. In cases where the rate of foreign tax on a corporation\u2019s income exceeds the U.  tax rate, the corporation is left paying the higher rate of tax. Under a pure territorial tax system the United States would simply exempt all foreign-source income. First, corporations can defer U.  tax indefinitely on certain foreign-source income, as long as they keep it reinvested abroad. The parent corporation generally can deduct its interest payments from its U.  taxes even if it defers U.  tax on the subsidiary\u2019s income by leaving it overseas. In the long run, after markets have adjusted, neither type of tax would have a significant effect on the U.  trade balance. The criteria for a good tax system, which our report discusses, provide the basis for a set of principles that should guide Congress as it considers the choices and tradeoffs involved in tax system reform. However, I have described some basic principles that ought to guide business tax reform. These proposals would significantly change tax rates, the tax base, and the level of tax (whether taxes are collected from individuals, businesses, or both). The RST is a consumption tax because only goods purchased by consumers are taxed, and sales to businesses, including sales of investment goods, are generally exempt from tax. However, businesses can either deduct the amount of their purchases of goods and services from other businesses (under a subtraction VAT) or can claim a credit for tax paid on purchases from other businesses (under a credit VAT). An income VAT would not allow businesses to deduct dividends, interest, or wages, so the income VAT remitted by businesses would include tax on these types of income. Instead of collecting tax on each sale of consumer products at the business level, a personal consumption tax would tax individuals annually on the sum of all their purchases of consumption goods.

Under the ASC payment system, Medicare pays a predetermined, and generally all- inclusive, amount per procedure to the facility. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Under the OPPS, hospital outpatient departments generally may not bill separately for implantable devices related to the procedure, but they may bill separately for additional services that are directly related to the procedure, such as certain drugs and diagnostic services, including X-rays. Hospital outpatient departments also may bill separately for additional services that are not directly related to the procedure and do not occur during the procedure, such as laboratory services to evaluate a tissue sample. Because they provide a broader array of services, and because CMS has encouraged hospitals to report all services provided during a procedure on their Medicare claims for rate-setting purposes, hospital claims may provide more detail about the services delivered during a procedure than ASC claims do. CMS set the initial 1982 ASC payment rates based on cost and charge data from 40 ASCs. At that time, there were about 125 ASCs in operation. <mask_1>. When the ASC payment system was first established, federal law required CMS to review the payment rates periodically. In 1986, CMS conducted an ASC survey to gather cost and charge data. In 1990, using these data, CMS revised the payment rates and increased the number of payment groups to eight. A ninth payment group was established in 1991. These groups are still in use, although some procedures have been added to or deleted from the ASC-approved list. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. However, CMS did not implement the proposal, and, as a result, the ASC payment system was not revised using the 1994 data. In 2003, MMA eliminated the requirement to conduct ASC surveys every 5 years and required CMS to implement a revised ASC payment system no later than January 1, 2008. During the course of our work, in August 2006, CMS published a proposed rule that would revise the ASC payment system effective January 1, 2008. In this proposed rule, CMS bases the revised ASC payment rates on the OPPS APC groups. However, the payment rates would be lower for ASCs. The initial OPPS payment rates, implemented in August 2000, were based on hospitals\u2019 1996 costs. To determine the OPPS payment rates, CMS first calculates each hospital\u2019s cost for each service by multiplying the charge for that service by a cost-to-charge ratio computed from the hospital\u2019s most recently reported data. After calculating the cost of each service for each hospital, the services are grouped by their APC assignment, and a median cost for each APC group is calculated from the median costs of all services assigned to it. Using the median cost, CMS assigns each APC group a weight based on its median cost relative to the median cost of all other APCs. To obtain a payment rate for each APC group, CMS multiplies the relative weight by a factor that converts it to a dollar amount. Beginning in 2002, as required by law, the APC group payment rates have been revised annually based on the latest charge and cost data. In addition, the payment rates for services paid under the OPPS receive an annual inflation update. We found many similarities in the additional services provided by ASCs and hospital outpatient departments with the top 20 procedures. Of the additional services billed with a procedure, few resulted in an additional payment in one setting but not the other. Hospitals were paid for some of the related additional services they billed with the procedures. In the ASC setting, other providers billed Medicare for these services and received payment for them. In our analysis of Medicare claims, we found many similarities in the additional services billed in the ASC or hospital outpatient department setting with the top 20 procedures. <mask_1>. First, one or more additional procedures was billed with a procedure performed in either the ASC or hospital outpatient department setting for 14 of the top 20 procedures. The proportion of time each additional procedure was billed in each setting was similar. For example, when a hammertoe repair procedure was performed, our analysis indicated that another procedure to correct a bunion was billed 11 percent of the time in the ASC setting, and in the hospital outpatient setting, the procedure to correct a bunion was billed 13 percent of the time. Similarly, when a diagnostic colonoscopy was performed, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy was billed 11 percent of the time in the ASC setting, and in the hospital setting, the upper GI endoscopy was billed 12 percent of the time. For 11 of these 14 procedures, the proportion of time each additional procedure was billed differed by less than 10 percentage points between the two settings. For the 3 remaining procedures, the percentage of time that an additional procedure was billed did not vary by more than 25 percentage points between the two settings. See appendix III for a complete list of the additional procedures billed and the proportion of time they were billed in each setting. Second, laboratory services were billed with 10 of the top 20 procedures in the hospital outpatient department setting and 7 of the top 20 procedures in the ASC setting. While these services were almost always billed by the hospital in the outpatient setting, they were typically not billed by the ASCs. These laboratory services were present in our analysis in the ASC setting because they were performed and billed by another Medicare part B provider. Third, four different radiology services were billed with 8 of the top 20 procedures. Radiology services were billed with 5 procedures in the ASC setting and with 8 procedures in the hospital outpatient department setting. The radiology services generally were included on the hospital outpatient department bills but rarely were included on the ASC bills. Similar to laboratory services, hospital outpatient departments billed for radiology services that they performed in addition to the procedures. <mask_1>. Fourth, anesthesia services were billed with 17 of the top 20 procedures in either the ASC or hospital outpatient settings and with 14 procedures in both settings. In virtually every case in the ASC setting, and most cases in the hospital outpatient department setting, these services were billed by another part B provider. According to our analysis, ASCs did not generally include any services other than the procedures they performed on their bills. However, in the hospital outpatient setting, some additional services were included on the hospitals\u2019 bills. We believe this is a result of the structure of the two payment systems. <mask_1>. In contrast, hospital outpatient departments\u2019 bills often include many of the individual items or services they provide as a part of a procedure because CMS has encouraged them to do so, whether the items or services are included in the OPPS payment or paid separately. <mask_1>. Under both the Medicare ASC and OPPS payment systems, when more than one procedure is performed at the same time, the facility receives 100 percent of the applicable payment for the procedure that has the highest payment rate and 50 percent of the applicable payment for each additional procedure. As this policy is applicable to both settings, for those instances in our analysis when an additional procedure was performed with one of the top 20 procedures in either setting, the ASC or hospital outpatient department received 100 percent of the payment for the procedure with the highest payment rate and 50 percent of the payment for each lesser paid procedure. Individual drugs were billed by hospital outpatient departments for most of the top 20 procedures, although they were not present on the claims from ASCs, likely because ASCs generally cannot receive separate Medicare payments for individual drugs. However, none of the individual drugs billed by the hospital outpatient departments in our analysis resulted in an additional payment to the hospitals. In each case, the cost of the particular drug was included in the Medicare payment for the procedure. <mask_1>. For both settings, the payment was made to the provider that performed the service. <mask_1>. Of the four radiology services in our analysis, three were similar to the laboratory services in that they are not included in the cost of the procedure and are separately paid services under Medicare. Therefore, when hospitals provided these services, they received payment for them. In the ASC setting, these services were typically billed by a provider other than the ASC, and the provider received payment for them. The fourth radiology service is included in the payment for the procedure with which it was associated. Therefore, no separate payment was made to either ASCs or hospital outpatient departments. With regard to anesthesia services, most services were billed by and paid to a provider other than an ASC or hospital. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We found that the ASC-to-APC cost ratios were more tightly distributed around their median cost ratio than the OPPS-to-APC cost ratios were around their median cost ratio. <mask_1>.<mask_1>.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In our analysis, we listed the procedures performed at ASCs and calculated the ratio of the cost of each procedure to the cost of the APC group to which it would have been assigned, referred to as the ASC-to-APC cost ratio. We then calculated similar cost ratios for the same procedures exclusively within the OPPS. To determine an OPPS-to-APC cost ratio, we divided individual procedures\u2019 median costs, as calculated by CMS for the OPPS, by the median cost of their APC group. Our analysis of the cost ratios showed that the ASC-to-APC cost ratios were more tightly distributed around their median than were the OPPS-to-APC cost ratios; that is, there were more of them closer to the median. <mask_1>.<mask_1>.<mask_1>. 1 and 2). Therefore, there is less variation in the ASC setting between individual procedures\u2019 costs and the costs of their assigned APC groups than there is in the hospital outpatient department setting. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Among all procedures in our analysis, the median ASC-to-APC cost ratio was 0.39. The ASC-to-APC cost ratios ranged from 0.02 to 3.34. When weighted by Medicare volume based on 2004 claims data, the median ASC- to-APC cost ratio was 0.84. We determined that the median OPPS-to-APC cost ratio was 1.04. <mask_1>. Generally, there are many similarities between the additional services provided in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments with one of the top 20 procedures, and few resulted in an additional Medicare payment to ASCs or hospital outpatient departments. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We received written comments on a draft of this report from CMS (see app. IV). We also received oral comments from external reviewers representing two ASC industry organizations, AAASC and FASA. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS stated that our recommendation is consistent with its August 2006 proposed revisions to the ASC payment system. Industry representatives who reviewed a draft of this report did not agree or disagree with our recommendation for executive action. They did, however, provide several comments on the draft report. <mask_1>. Regarding this comment, we initially considered developing our survey sample stratified by ASC specialty type. However, because accurate data identifying ASCs\u2019 specialties do not exist, we were unable to stratify our survey sample by specialty type. <mask_1>. We expanded the discussion of how we developed the relative weight scale in our methodology section. Reviewers also made technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. We are sending a copy of this report to the Administrator of CMS and appropriate congressional committees. The report is available at no charge on GAO\u2019s Web site at http://www.gao.gov. We will also make copies available to others on request. If you or your staff members have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7119 or kingk@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff members who made significant contributions to this report are listed in appendix V. The Medicare payment rates for ambulatory surgical centers (ASC), along with those of other facilities, are adjusted to account for the variation in labor costs across the country. To calculate payment rates for individual ASCs, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) calculates the share of total costs that are labor-related and then adjusts ASCs\u2019 labor- related share of costs based on a wage index calculated for specific geographic areas across the country. The wage index reflects how the average wage for health care personnel in each geographic area compares to the national average health care personnel wage. The geographic areas are intended to represent the separate labor markets in which health care facilities compete for employees. In setting the initial ASC payment rates for 1982, CMS determined from the first survey of ASCs that one-third of their costs were labor-related. The labor-related costs included employee salaries and fringe benefits, contractual personnel, and owners\u2019 compensation for duties performed for the facility. To determine the payment rates for each individual ASC, CMS multiplied one-third of the payment rate for each procedure\u2014the labor- related portion\u2014by the local area wage index. Each ASC received the base payment rate for two-thirds of the payment rate\u2014the nonlabor-related portion\u2014for each procedure. The sum of the labor-related and nonlabor- related portions equaled each ASC\u2019s payment rate for each procedure. In 1990, when CMS revised the payment system based on a 1986 ASC survey, CMS found ASCs\u2019 average labor-related share of costs to be 34.45 percent and used this percentage as the labor-related portion of the payment rate. In a 1998 proposed rule, CMS noted that ASCs\u2019 share of labor-related costs as calculated from the 1994 ASC cost survey had increased to an average of 37.66 percent, slightly higher than the percentage calculated from the 1986 survey. However, CMS did not implement the 1998 proposal. <mask_1>.<mask_1>. Using 2004 cost data we received from 290 ASCs that responded to our survey request for information, we determined that the mean labor-related proportion of costs was 50 percent, and the range of the labor-related costs for the middle 50 percent of our ASC facilities was 43 percent to 57 percent of total costs. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We also interviewed officials at CMS and representatives from ASC industry organizations, specifically, the American Association of Ambulatory Surgery Centers (AAASC) and FASA, physician specialty societies, and nine ASCs. <mask_1>. These procedures represented approximately 75 percent of all Medicare ASC claims in 2003. Using Medicare claims data for 2003, we identified beneficiaries receiving one of the top 20 procedures in either an ASC or hospital outpatient department, then identified any other claims for those beneficiaries from ASCs, hospital outpatient departments, durable medical equipment suppliers, and other Medicare part B providers. We identified claims for the beneficiaries on the day the procedure was performed and the day after. We created a list that included all additional services that were billed at least 10 percent of the time with each of the top 20 procedures when they were performed in ASCs. We created a similar list of additional services for each of the top 20 procedures when they were performed in hospital outpatient departments. We then compared the lists for each of the top 20 procedures between the two settings to determine whether there were similarities in the additional services that were billed to Medicare. <mask_1>. We used Medicare claims data from the National Claims History (NCH) files. These data, which are used by the Medicare program to make payments to health care providers, are closely monitored by both CMS and the Medicare contractors that process, review, and pay claims for Medicare services. The data are subject to various internal controls, including checks and edits performed by the contractors before claims are submitted to CMS for payment approval. Although we did not review these internal controls, we did assess the reliability of the NCH data. First, we reviewed all existing information about the data, including the data dictionary and file layouts. We also interviewed experts at CMS who regularly use the data for evaluation and analysis. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We received response data from 397 ASC facilities. We assessed the reliability of these data through several means. We identified incomplete and inconsistent survey responses within individual surveys and placed follow-up calls to respondents to complete or verify their responses. To ensure that survey response data were accurately transferred to electronic files for our analytic purposes, two analysts independently entered all survey responses. Any discrepancies between the two sets of entered responses were resolved. <mask_1>. As a result of our data reliability testing, we determined that data from 290 responding facilities were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Our nonresponse analysis showed that there was no geographic bias among the facilities responding to our survey. The responding facilities performed more Medicare services than the average for all ASCs in our sample. To allocate ASCs\u2019 total costs among the individual procedures they perform, we developed a method to allocate the portion of an ASC\u2019s costs accounted for by each procedure. <mask_1>. The resources we used were the clinical staff time, surgical supplies, and surgical equipment used during the procedures. We used cost and quantity data on these resources from information CMS had collected for the purpose of setting the practice expense component of physician payment rates. <mask_1>. We summed the costs of the resources for each procedure and created a relative weight scale by dividing the total cost of each procedure by the average cost across all of the procedures. We assessed the reliability of these data through several means. We compared electronic CMS data with the original document sources for a large sample of records, performed electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness, and reviewed data for reasonableness. Based on these efforts, we determined that data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. <mask_1>. (See fig. 3 for our per- procedure cost calculation methodology.) We also deducted costs for services that Medicare pays for separately, such as physician and nonphysician practitioner services. We then separated each facility\u2019s total costs into its direct and indirect costs. We defined direct costs as those associated with the clinical staff, equipment, and supplies used during the procedure. Indirect costs included all remaining costs, such as support and administrative staff, building expenses, and outside services purchased. To allocate each facility\u2019s direct costs across the procedures it performed, we applied our relative weight scale. We allocated indirect costs equally across all procedures performed by the facility. For each procedure performed by a responding ASC facility, we summed its allocated direct and indirect costs to determine a total cost for the procedure. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We also obtained from CMS the OPPS median cost of each procedure and the median cost of each APC group. We then calculated a ratio between each procedure\u2019s ASC median cost, as determined by the survey, and the median cost of each procedure\u2019s corresponding APC group under the OPPS, referred to as the ASC-to-APC cost ratio. We also calculated a ratio between each ASC procedure\u2019s median cost under the OPPS and the median cost of the procedure\u2019s APC group, using the data obtained from CMS, referred to as the OPPS-to-APC cost ratio. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. To calculate the percentage of labor-related costs among our sample ASCs, for each ASC, we divided total labor costs by total costs, after deducting costs not covered by Medicare\u2019s facility payment. We then determined the range of the percentage of labor-related costs among all of our ASCs and between the 25th percentile and the 75th percentile, as well as the mean and median percentage of labor-related costs. We performed our work from April 2004 through October 2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix III: Additional Procedures Billed with the Top 20 ASC Procedures, 2003 (percentage) N/A (percentage) In addition to the contact named above, key contributors to this report were Nancy A. Edwards, Assistant Director; Kevin Dietz; Beth Cameron Feldpush; Marc Feuerberg; and Nora Hoban.", "labels": "Appendix III: Additional Procedures Billed with the Top 20 ASC Procedures, 2003 (percentage) N/A (percentage)Under the ASC payment system, Medicare pays a predetermined, and generally all- inclusive, amount per procedure to the facility. . There are some similarities in how Medicare pays ASCs and hospital outpatient departments for the procedures they perform. However, the methods used by CMS to calculate the payment rates in each system, as well as the mechanisms used to revise the Medicare payment rates, differ. In 1980, legislation was enacted that enabled ASCs to bill Medicare for certain surgical procedures provided to Medicare beneficiaries. The approximately 2,500 surgical procedures that ASCs may bill for under Medicare are assigned to one of nine payment groups that contain procedures with similar costs, but not necessarily clinical similarities. All procedures assigned to one payment group are paid at the same rate. Under the Medicare payment system, when more than one procedure is performed at the same time, the ASC receives a payment for each of the procedures. However, the procedure that has the highest payment rate receives 100 percent of the applicable payment, and each additional procedure receives 50 percent of the applicable payment. The Medicare payment for a procedure performed at an ASC is intended to cover the direct costs for a procedure, such as nursing and technician services, drugs, medical and surgical supplies and equipment, anesthesia materials, and diagnostic services (including imaging services), and the indirect costs associated with the procedure, including use of the facility and related administrative services. The ASC payment for a procedure does not include payment for implantable devices or prosthetics related to the procedure; ASCs may bill separately for those items. In addition, the payment to the ASC does not include payment for professional services associated with the procedure; the physician who performs the procedure and the anesthesiologist or anesthetist bill Medicare directly for their services. Finally, the ASC payment does not include payment for certain other services that are not directly related to performing the procedure and do not occur during the time that the procedure takes place, such as some laboratory, X-ray, and other diagnostic tests. Because these additional services are not ASC procedures, they may be performed by another provider. In those cases, Medicare makes payments to those providers for the additional services. For example, a laboratory service needed to evaluate a tissue sample removed during an ASC procedure is not included in the ASC payment. The provider that evaluated the tissue sample would bill and receive payment from Medicare for that service. Because ASCs receive one inclusive payment for the procedure performed and its associated services, such as drugs, they generally include on their Medicare claim only the procedure performed. In 1997, legislation was enacted that required the implementation of a prospective payment system for hospital outpatient departments; the OPPS was implemented in August 2000. Although ASCs perform only procedures, hospital outpatient departments provide a much broader array of services, including diagnostic services, such as X-rays and laboratory tests, and emergency room and clinic visits. Each of the approximately 5,500 services, including procedures, that hospital outpatient departments perform is assigned to one of over 800 APC groups with other services with clinical and cost similarities for payment under the OPPS. All services assigned to one APC group are paid the same rate. Similar to ASCs, when hospitals perform multiple procedures at the same time, they receive 100 percent of the applicable payment for the procedure that has the highest payment rate, and 50 percent of the applicable payment for each additional procedure, subject to certain exceptions. Like payments to ASCs, payment for a procedure under the OPPS is intended to cover the costs of the use of the facility, nursing and technician services, most drugs, medical and surgical supplies and equipment, anesthesia materials, and administrative costs. Medicare payment to a hospital for a procedure does not include professional services for physicians or other nonphysician practitioners. These services are paid for separately by Medicare. However, there are some differences between ASC and OPPS payments for procedures. Procedures were placed into four payment groups, and all procedures in a group were paid the same rate. Although payments have not been revised using ASC cost data since 1990, the payment rates have been periodically updated for inflation. In 1994, Congress required that CMS conduct a survey of ASC costs no later than January 1, 1995, and thereafter every 5 years, to revise ASC payment rates. CMS conducted a survey in 1994 to collect ASC cost data. In 1998, CMS proposed revising ASC payment rates based on the 1994 survey data and assigned procedures performed at ASCs into payment groups that were comparable to the payment groups it was developing for the same procedures under the OPPS. The similar additional services are illustrated in the following four categories of services: additional procedures, laboratory services, radiology services, and anesthesia services. When radiology services were billed with procedures in the ASC setting, these services generally were performed and billed by another part B provider. As ASCs generally receive payment from Medicare only for procedures, they typically include only those procedures on their bills. With the exception of additional procedures, there were few separate payments that could be made for additional services provided with the top 20 procedures because most of the services in our analysis were included in the Medicare payment to the ASC or hospital. In the case of the laboratory services billed with procedures in the ASC and hospital outpatient department settings, those services were not costs included in the payment for the procedure in either setting and were paid separately in each case. In the case of the hospital outpatient department setting, the payment was generally made to the hospital, while, for procedures performed at ASCs, payment was made to another provider who performed the service. As a group, the costs of procedures performed in ASCs have a relatively consistent relationship with the costs of the APC groups to which they would be assigned under the OPPS. That is, the APC groups accurately reflect the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs. Specifically, 45 percent of all procedures in our analysis fell within 0. 10 points of the ASC-to-APC median cost ratio, and 33 percent of procedures fell within 0. 10 points of the OPPS-to-APC median cost ratio. However, the costs of procedures in ASCs are substantially lower than costs for the same procedures in the hospital outpatient setting. The APC groups reflect the relative costs of procedures provided by ASCs as well as they reflect the relative costs of procedures provided in the hospital outpatient department setting. Specifically, 45 percent of procedures performed in ASCs fell within a 0. 10 point range of the ASC-to-APC median cost ratio, and 33 percent of those procedures fell within a 0. 10 point range of the OPPS-to-APC median cost ratio in the hospital outpatient department setting (see figs. From this outcome, we determined that the OPPS APC groups could be used to pay for procedures in ASCs. The median costs of procedures performed in ASCs were generally lower than the median costs of their corresponding APC group under the OPPS. This analysis shows that when compared to the median cost of the same APC group, procedures performed in ASCs had substantially lower costs than when those same procedures were performed in hospital outpatient departments. Although costs for individual procedures vary, in general, the median costs for procedures are lower in ASCs, relative to the median costs of their APC groups, than the median costs for the same procedures in the hospital outpatient department setting. The APC groups in the OPPS reflect the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs in the same way that they reflect the relative costs of the same procedures when they are performed in hospital outpatient departments. Therefore, the APC groups could be applied to procedures performed in ASCs, and the OPPS could be used as the basis for an ASC payment system, eliminating the need for ASC surveys and providing for an annual revision of the ASC payment groups. We recommend that the Administrator of CMS implement a payment system for procedures performed in ASCs based on the OPPS. The Administrator should take into account the lower relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs compared to hospital outpatient departments in determining ASC payment rates. The industry representatives noted that we did not analyze the survey results to examine differences in per-procedure costs among single-specialty and multi-specialty ASCs. The industry representatives asked us to provide more explanation in our scope and methodology regarding our development of a relative weight scale for Medicare ASC-approved procedures to capture the general variation in resources associated with performing different procedures. Currently, the labor-related proportion of costs from CMS\u2019s 1986 survey, 34. 45 percent, is used for calculating ASC payment rates. To compare the delivery of procedures between ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we analyzed Medicare claims data from 2003. To compare the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we collected cost and procedure data from 2004 from a sample of Medicare-participating ASCs. To compare the delivery of additional services provided with procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we identified all additional services frequently billed in each setting when one of the top 20 procedures with the highest Medicare ASC claims volume is performed. To compare the Medicare payments for procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we identified whether any additional services included in our analysis resulted in an additional payment. To compare the relative costs of procedures performed in ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we first compiled information on ASCs\u2019 costs and procedures performed. Because there were no recent existing data on ASC costs, we surveyed 600 ASCs, randomly selected from all ASCs, to obtain their 2004 cost and procedure data. We performed electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness, including an analysis of costs per procedure. We constructed a relative weight scale for Medicare ASC-approved procedures that captures the general variation in resources associated with performing different procedures. For procedures for which CMS had no data on the resources used, we used information we collected from medical specialty societies and physicians who work for CMS. To calculate per-procedure costs with the data from the surveyed ASC facilities, we first deducted costs that Medicare considers unallowable, such as advertising and entertainment costs. To obtain a per-procedure cost across all ASCs, we arrayed the calculated costs for all ASCs performing that procedure and identified the median cost. To compare per-procedure costs for ASCs and hospital outpatient departments, we first obtained from CMS the list of ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups used for the outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the procedures assigned to each APC group. To evaluate the difference in procedure costs between the two settings, we compared the ASC-to- APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios. To assess how well the relative costs of procedures in the OPPS, defined by their assignment to APC groups, reflect the relative costs of procedures in the ASC setting, we evaluated the distribution of the ASC-to-APC and OPPS-to-APC cost ratios.

According to officials, criminals used taxpayer- specific data acquired from non-department sources to gain unauthorized access to information on approximately 100,000 tax accounts. These data included Social Security information, dates of birth, and street addresses. <mask_1>. In a February 2016 update, the agency reported that an additional 390,000 accounts had been accessed. Thus, about 724,000 accounts were reportedly affected. The online Get Transcript service has been unavailable since May 2015. <mask_1>.<mask_1>. The IP PIN is a single-use identification number provided to taxpayers who are victims of identity theft (IDT) to help prevent future IDT refund fraud. <mask_1>. These checks confirm taxpayer identity by asking for personal, financial and tax-related information. <mask_1>. As of April 7, the online service was still suspended. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has overall responsibility for ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support the agency and its operations. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Access controls are intended to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities. These controls include identification and authentication, authorization, cryptography, audit and monitoring, and physical security controls, among others. <mask_1>. Identifying and authenticating users\u2014such as through user account-password combinations\u2014provides the basis for establishing accountability and controlling access to a system. <mask_1>. It also improved identification and authentication controls by, for example, expanding the use of an automated mechanism to centrally manage, apply, and verify password requirements. However, weaknesses in identification and authentication controls remained. For example, the agency used easily guessable passwords on servers supporting key systems. Authorization controls limit what actions users are able to perform after being allowed into a system and should be based on the concept of \u201cleast privilege,\u201d granting users the least amount of rights and privileges necessary to perform their duties. <mask_1>. For example, users were granted rights and permissions in excess of what they needed to perform their duties, including for an application used to process electronic tax payment information and a database on a human resources system. Cryptography controls protect sensitive data and computer programs by rendering data unintelligible to unauthorized users and protecting the integrity of transmitted or stored data. <mask_1>. However, key systems we reviewed had not been configured to encrypt sensitive user authentication data. Audit and monitoring is the regular collection, review, and analysis of events on systems and networks in order to detect, respond to, and investigate unusual activity. <mask_1>. But it had not established logging for two key applications used to support the transfer of financial data and access and manage taxpayer accounts; nor was the agency consistently maintaining key system and application audit plans. Physical security controls, such as physical access cards, limit access to an organization\u2019s overall facility and areas housing sensitive IT components. <mask_1>. However, the agency had yet to address weaknesses in its review of access lists for both employees and visitors to sensitive areas. <mask_1>.g.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Moreover, the agency had documented and tested contingency plans for its systems and improved continuity of operations controls for several systems. <mask_1>. The agency established a comprehensive framework for its program, including assessing risk for its systems, developing system security plans, and providing employees with security awareness and specialized training. <mask_1>. In addition, the agency had not fully addressed previously identified deficiencies or ensured that its corrective actions were effective. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Implementing these recommendations\u2014in addition to the 49 outstanding recommendations from previous audits\u2014will help IRS improve its controls for identifying and authenticating users, limiting users\u2019 access to the minimum necessary to perform their job-related functions, protecting sensitive data when they are stored or in transit, auditing and monitoring system activities, and physically securing its IT facilities and resources. Table 1 below provides the number of our prior recommendations to IRS that were not implemented at the beginning of our fiscal year 2015 audit, how many were resolved by the end of the audit, new recommendations, and the total number of outstanding recommendations at the conclusion of the audit. In commenting on drafts of our reports presenting the results of our fiscal year 2015 audit, the IRS Commissioner stated that while the agency agreed with our new recommendations, it will review them to ensure that its actions include sustainable fixes that implement appropriate security controls balanced against IT and human capital resource limitations. In addition, IRS can take steps to improve its response to data breaches. Specifically, in December 2013 we reported on the extent to which data breach policies at eight agencies, including IRS, adhered to requirements and guidance set forth by the Office of Management and Budget and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. While the agencies in our review generally had policies and procedures in place that reflected the major elements of an effective data breach response program, implementation of these policies and procedures was not consistent. With respect to IRS, we determined that its policies and procedures generally reflected key practices, although the agency did not require considering the number of affected individuals as a factor when determining if affected individuals should be notified of a suspected breach. In addition, IRS did not document lessons learned from periodic analyses of its breach response efforts. We recommended that IRS correct these weaknesses, but the agency has yet to fully address them. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. While its estimates have inherent uncertainty, IRS estimated that it prevented or recovered $22.5 billion in fraudulent IDT refunds in filing season 2014 (see figure 1). However, IRS also estimated, where data were available, that it paid $3.1 billion in fraudulent IDT refunds. Because of the difficulties in knowing the amount of undetectable fraud, the actual amount could differ from these estimates. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In fiscal year 2015, IRS reported that it staffed more than 4,000 full-time equivalents and spent about $470 million on all refund fraud and IDT activities. <mask_1>.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. For example, between the 2011 and 2015 filing seasons, IRS experienced a 430 percent increase in the number of telephone calls to its Identity Theft Toll Free Line\u2014as of March 19, 2016, IRS had received over 1.1 million calls to this line. Moreover, 77 percent of callers seeking assistance on this telephone line received it compared to 54 percent during the same period last year. Average wait times during the same period have also decreased\u2014taxpayers are waiting an average of 14 minutes to talk to an assistor, a decrease from 27 minutes last year. <mask_1>. In March 2015, the IRS Commissioner convened a Security Summit with industry and states to improve information sharing and authentication. <mask_1>. IRS plans to invest a portion of the $16.1 million it received in fiscal year 2016 into identity theft prevention and refund fraud mitigation actions from the Security Summit. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Without additional action by IRS and Congress, the risk of issuing fraudulent IDT refunds could grow. <mask_1>. In January 2015, we reported that IRS\u2019s authentication tools have limitations and recommended that IRS assess the costs, benefits and risks of its authentication tools. For example, individuals can obtain an e-file PIN by providing their name, Social Security number, date of birth, address, and filing status for IRS\u2019s e-file PIN application. Identity thieves can easily find this information, allowing them to bypass some, if not all, of IRS\u2019s automatic checks, according to our analysis and interviews with tax software and return preparer associations and companies. After filing an IDT return using an e-file PIN, the fraudulent return would proceed through IRS\u2019s normal return processing. <mask_1>. IRS also noted that the methods of analysis for the authentication tools will vary depending on the different costs and other factors for authenticating taxpayers in different channels, such as online, phone, or in-person. <mask_1>. While IRS is taking steps, it will still be vulnerable until it completes and uses the results of its analysis of costs, benefits, and risk to inform decision-making. Form W-2, Wage and Tax Statement (W-2) Pre-refund Matching. In August 2014 we reported that the wage information that employers report on Form W-2 is not available to IRS until after it issues most refunds, and that if IRS had access to W-2 data earlier, it could match such information to taxpayers\u2019 returns and identify discrepancies before issuing billions of dollars of fraudulent IDT refunds. We recommended that IRS assess the costs and benefits of accelerating W-2 deadlines. <mask_1>. In December 2015, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2016 amended the tax code to accelerate W-2 filing deadlines to January 31. IRS\u2019s report will help IRS determine how to best implement pre- refund W-2 matching, given the new January 31st deadline for filing W-2s. Additionally, we suggested that Congress should consider providing the Secretary of the Treasury with the regulatory authority to lower the threshold for electronic filing of W-2s, which could make more W-2 information available to IRS earlier. External Leads. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In November 2015, IRS reported that it had developed a database to track leads submitted by financial institutions and the results of those leads. IRS also stated that it had held two sessions with financial institutions to provide feedback on external leads provided to IRS. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. IRS and industry partners have characterized that returns processing and refund issuance during this filing season has been generally smooth. Through April 1, 2016, IRS had processed about 95 million returns and issued 76 million refunds totaling about $215 billion. While IRS experienced a major system failure in February that halted returns processing for about a day, the agency reported that it had minimal effect on overall processing of returns and refunds. In addition to filing returns, many taxpayers often call IRS for assistance. IRS\u2019s telephone service has generally improved in 2016 over last year. From January 1 through March 19, 2016 IRS received about 35.4 million calls to its automated and live assistor telephone lines, about a 2 percent decrease compared to the same period last year. Of the 13.4 million calls seeking live assistance, IRS had answered 9.1 million calls\u2014a 75 percent increase over the 5.2 million calls answered during the same period last year. IRS anticipated that 65 percent of callers seeking live assistance would receive it this filing season, which runs through April 18, and 47 percent of callers would receive live assistance through the entire 2016 fiscal year. As of March 19, 2016, 75 percent of callers had received live assistance, an increase from 38 percent during the same period last year. Further, the average wait time to speak to an assistor also decreased from 24 to 9 minutes. As we reported in March 2016, however, IRS\u2019s telephone level of service for the full fiscal year has yet to reach the levels it had achieved in earlier years. IRS attributed this year\u2019s service improvement to a number of factors. Of the additional $290 million IRS received in December 2015, it allocated $178.4 million (61.5 percent) for taxpayer services to make measurable improvements in its telephone level of service. With the funds, IRS hired 1,000 assistors who began answering taxpayer calls in March, in addition to the approximately 2,000 seasonal assistors it had hired in fall 2015. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. IRS also plans to use about 600 full-time equivalents of overtime for assistors to answer telephone calls and respond to correspondence in fiscal year 2016, compared to fewer than 60 full-time equivalents of overtime used in fiscal year 2015. In December 2014, we recommended that IRS systematically and periodically compare its telephone service to the best in business to identify gaps between actual and desired performance. IRS disagreed with this recommendation, noting that it is difficult to identify comparable organizations. We do not agree with IRS\u2019s position; many organizations run call centers that would provide ample opportunities to benchmark IRS\u2019s performance. <mask_1>. Without such a strategy, Treasury and IRS can neither measure nor effectively communicate to Congress the types and levels of customer service taxpayers should expect and the resources needed to reach those levels. Therefore, in December 2015 we suggested that Congress consider requiring that Treasury work with IRS to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. The risks IRS and the public are exposed to have been illustrated by recent incidents involving public- facing applications, highlighting the importance of securing systems that contain sensitive taxpayer and financial data. In addition, fully implementing key elements of a breach response program will help ensure that when breaches of sensitive data do occur, their impact on affected individuals will be minimized. Weaknesses in information security can also increase the risk posed by identity theft refund fraud. IRS needs to establish an approach for addressing identity theft refund fraud that is informed by assessing the cost, benefits, and risks of IRS\u2019s various authentication options and improving the reliability of fraud estimates. While this year\u2019s tax filing season has generally gone smoothly and IRS has improved customer service, it still needs to develop a comprehensive approach to customer service that will meet the needs of taxpayers while ensuring that their sensitive information is adequately protected.

IRS\u2019s mission is to provide America\u2019s taxpayers top-quality service by helping them to understand and meet their tax responsibilities and to enforce the law with integrity and fairness to all. S. g. During fiscal year 2015, IRS collected more than $3. 3 trillion; processed more than 243 million tax returns and other forms; and issued more than $403 billion in tax refunds. IRS employs about 90,000 people in its Washington, D. C. , headquarters and at more than 550 offices in all 50 states, U.  territories, and some U.  embassies and consulates. Each filing season IRS provides assistance to tens of millions of taxpayers over the phone, through written correspondence, online, and face-to-face. In carrying out its mission, IRS relies extensively on computerized information systems, which it must effectively secure to protect sensitive financial and taxpayer data for the collection of taxes, processing of tax returns, and enforcement of federal tax laws. Accordingly, it is critical for IRS to effectively implement information security controls and an agency- wide information security program in accordance with federal law and guidance. Regarding IRS specifically, two recent incidents illustrate the impact on taxpayer and other sensitive information: In June 2015, the Commissioner of the IRS testified that unauthorized third parties had gained access to taxpayer information from its Get Transcript application. In an August 2015 update, IRS reported this number to be about 114,000, and that an additional 220,000 accounts had been inappropriately accessed. In March 2016, IRS stated that as part of its ongoing security review, it had temporarily suspended the Identity Protection Personal Identification Number (IP PIN) service on IRS. gov. The service on IRS\u2019s website allowed taxpayers to retrieve their IP PINs online by passing IRS\u2019s authentication checks. The IRS stated that it was conducting further review of the IP PIN service and is looking at further strengthening the security features before resuming service. Within IRS, the senior agency official responsible for information security is the Associate CIO, who heads the IRS Information Technology Cybersecurity organization. As we reported in March 2016, IRS has implemented numerous controls over key financial and tax processing systems; however, it had not always effectively implemented access and other controls, including elements of its information security program. In our most recent review we found that IRS had improved access controls, but some weaknesses remain. IRS established policies for identification and authentication, including requiring multifactor authentication for local and network access accounts and establishing password complexity and expiration requirements. While IRS established policies for authorizing access to its systems, it continued to permit excessive access in some cases. IRS policies require the use of encryption and it continued to expand its use of encryption to protect sensitive data. IRS established policies and procedures for auditing and monitoring its systems and continued to enhance its capability by, for example, implementing an automated mechanism to log user activity on its access request and approval system. IRS established policies for physically protecting its computer resources and physical security controls at its enterprise computer centers, such as a dedicated guard force at each of its computer centers. IRS also had weaknesses in configuration management controls, which are intended to prevent unauthorized changes to information system resources (e. , software and hardware) and provide assurance that systems are configured and operating securely. Specifically, while IRS developed policies for managing the configuration of its information technology (IT) systems and improved some configuration management controls, it did not, for example, ensure security patch updates were applied in a timely manner to databases supporting 2 key systems we reviewed, including a patch that had been available since August 2012. To its credit, IRS had established contingency plans for the systems we reviewed, which help ensure that when unexpected events occur, critical operations can continue without interruption or can be promptly resumed, and that information resources are protected. Specifically, IRS had established policies for developing contingency plans for its information systems and for testing those plans, as well as for implementing and enforcing backup procedures. Nevertheless, the control weaknesses can be attributed in part to IRS\u2019s inconsistent implementation of elements of its agency-wide information security program. However, IRS had not updated key mainframe policies and procedures to address issues such as comprehensively auditing and monitoring access. During our most recent review, IRS told us it had addressed 28 of our prior recommendations; however, we determined that 9 of these had not been effectively implemented. The collective effect of the deficiencies in information security from prior years that continued to exist in fiscal year 2015, along with the new deficiencies we identified, are serious enough to merit the attention of those charged with governance of IRS and therefore represented a significant deficiency in IRS\u2019s internal control over financial reporting systems as of September 30, 2015. To assist IRS in fully implementing its agency-wide information security program, we made two new recommendations to more effectively implement security-related policies and plans. In addition, to assist IRS in strengthening security controls over the financial and tax processing systems we reviewed, we made 43 technical recommendations in a separate report with limited distribution to address 26 new weaknesses in access controls and configuration management. The importance of protecting taxpayer information is further highlighted by the billions of dollars that have been lost to IDT refund fraud, which continues to be an evolving threat. IRS develops estimates of the extent of IDT refund fraud to help direct its efforts to identify and prevent the crime. IRS has taken steps to address IDT refund fraud; however, it remains a persistent and continually changing threat. IRS recognized the challenge of IDT refund fraud in its fiscal year 2014-2017 strategic plan and increased resources dedicated to combating IDT and other types of refund fraud. As described above, IRS received an additional $290 million for fiscal year 2016 to improve customer service, IDT identification and prevention, and cybersecurity efforts and the agency plans to use $16. 1 million of this funding to help prevent IDT refund fraud, among other things. The administration requested an additional $90 million and an additional 491 full-time equivalents for fiscal year 2017 to help prevent IDT refund fraud and reduce other improper payments. IRS estimates that this $90 million investment in IDT refund fraud and other improper payment prevention would help it protect $612 million in revenue in fiscal year 2017, as well as protect revenue in future years. IRS has taken action to improve customer service related to IDT refund fraud. IRS also works with third parties, such as tax preparation industry participants, states, and financial institutions to try to detect and prevent IDT refund fraud. IRS officials said that 40 state departments of revenue and 20 tax industry participants have officially signed a partnership agreement to enact recommendations developed and agreed to by summit participants. These efforts include developing an Information Sharing and Analysis Center where IRS, states, and industry can share information to combat IDT refund fraud. Even though IRS has prioritized combating IDT refund fraud, fraudsters adapt their schemes to identify weaknesses in IDT defenses, such as gaining access to taxpayers\u2019 tax return transcripts through IRS\u2019s online Get Transcript service. According to IRS officials, with access to tax transcripts, fraudsters can create historically consistent returns that are hard to distinguish from a return filed by a legitimate taxpayer, potentially making it more difficult for IRS to identify and detect IDT refund fraud. We previously made recommendations to IRS to help it better combat IDT refund fraud: Authentication. In November 2015, IRS officials told us that the agency had developed guidance for its Identity Assurance Office to assess costs, benefits, and risk, and that its analysis will inform decision-making on authentication-related issues. In February 2016, IRS officials told us that the Identity Assurance Office plans to complete a strategic plan for taxpayer authentication across the agency in September 2016. In response to our recommendation, IRS provided us with a report in September 2015 discussing (1) adjustments to IRS systems and work processes needed to use accelerated W-2 information, (2) the potential impacts on internal and external stakeholders, and (3) other changes needed to match W-2 data to tax returns prior to issuing refunds, such as delaying refunds until W-2 data are available. IRS partners with financial institutions and other external parties to obtain information about emerging IDT refund trends and fraudulent returns that have passed through IRS detection systems. In August 2014, we reported that IRS provides limited feedback to external parties on IDT external leads they submit and offers external parties limited general information on IDT refund fraud trends and recommended that IRS provide actionable feedback to all lead generating third parties. In December 2015, IRS officials stated that the agency sent a customer satisfaction survey asking financial institutions for feedback on the external leads process and was considering other ways to provide feedback to financial institutions. In April 2016, IRS officials stated they plan to analyze preliminary survey results by mid-April 2016. Additionally, IRS officials reported that the agency shared information with financial institutions in March 2016 and plans to do so on a quarterly basis, with the next information sharing session scheduled in June 2016. To help answer taxpayer calls before March, IRS officials told us that they detailed 275 staff from one of its compliance functions to answer telephone calls. IRS officials said they believe this step was necessary because the additional funding came too late in the year to hire and train assistors to fully cover the filing season. In fall 2015, Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and IRS officials said they had no plans to develop a comprehensive customer service strategy or specific goals for telephone service tied to the best in the business and customer expectations. In April 2016, IRS officials told us that the agency established a team to consider our prior work in developing this strategy or benchmarking its telephone service. In summary, while IRS has made progress in implementing information security controls, it needs to continue to address weaknesses in access controls and configuration management and consistently implement all elements of its information security program. "}, {"inputs": "<mask_1><mask_1>. <mask_1>. The field structure designed to carry out INS\u2019 enforcement functions was bifurcated between districts and Border Patrol sectors, resulting in uncoordinated, overlapping programs. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. First, the headquarters operations office\u2019s unrealistically large span of control resulting in uneven and poorly coordinated field performance. Second, the lack of focus on program planning resulting from the operations office\u2019s preoccupation with matters that should have been handled by field managers. The Commissioner shifted some management authority to officials closer to field activities. <mask_1>. For example, in 1997 we reported that the responsibilities and authority of the Office of Field Operations and Office of Programs were unclear. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. As previously mentioned, INS\u2019 mission involves carrying out two primary functions\u2014enforcing immigration laws and providing services or benefits to eligible legal immigrants. These functions often translate into competing priorities at the program level that need to be balanced for effective program implementation. All too often, the emphasis placed on one over the other results in ineffective enforcement or poor benefit delivery. An example of this inability to balance these priorities can be found in our September 2000 report on the processing of visas for specialty occupations, called H-1B visas. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Some adjudicators told us that because of pressure to adjudicate cases quickly, they did not routinely use investigations staff to look into potentially fraudulent applications because doing so would take more time and reduce the number of applications they could complete. INS investigators following up on approved applications found instances of fraud; for example, they found employers who created shell corporations and false credentials and documents for aliens ineligible for H-1B employment. We found other examples where the goal of providing timely service delivery has negatively impacted INS\u2019 enforcement goal of providing benefits to only eligible aliens. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. However, in fiscal year 2000 INS denied about 80,000 applicants for adjustment of status (about 14 percent of all the adjustment of status applications completed) and had to revoke their work authorization. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We will discuss this and other issues related to immigration benefit fraud in a report to be released later this year. <mask_1>. For example, the Visa Waiver Program allows nationals of certain counties to enter the United States with just a passport. No visa is required. According to a Department of Justice OIG report, abuse of the program poses a threat to national security and increases illegal immigration. The report found that aliens used stolen passports from Visa Waiver countries to illegally enter the United States. In one case, the OIG found that 27 stolen Icelandic passports had been used to smuggle children into the United States.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Although some adjudicators believed the number of fraudulent applications submitted was significantly higher than the number they were detecting, they received little training in fraud detection. According to the report, some management and operations personnel indicated that performance evaluations in large part are based on the quantity of applications processed. The report concluded that whether employees receive incentives and rewards depends more on the quantity of applications processed rather than on fraud detection. Therefore, adjudicators had no incentives to actively search out fraud. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In our 1997 management report, we found that poor communication was a problem, especially between headquarters and field units. For example, field and policy manuals were out of date and there was not one place that program staff could go for direction. <mask_1>. As noted earlier in our testimony, how INS\u2019 Office of Programs and Office of Field Operations were to coordinate was still unclear. Our recent work shows that coordination and communication is still a problem. For example, although both the Border Patrol and INS\u2019 Office of Investigations have anti-smuggling units that conduct alien smuggling investigations, these units operate through separate chains of command with different reporting structures. In May 2000, we reported that alien smuggling was a growing problem, and that the Border Patrol and Investigations anti-smuggling units operated autonomously, resulting in a lack of program coordination. Further, this lack of coordination sometimes led to different anti-smuggling units opening investigations on the same target. <mask_1>. Communicating the necessary information to the appropriate individuals has also been a problem. In our H-1B report, we stated that adjudicators told us that they did not have easy access to case-specific information that would have helped them correctly decide whether an application should be approved or denied. For example, evidence of a fraudulent employer or falsified worker credentials either was not available to the adjudicator or could only be accessed through a time-consuming and complicated process. Consequently, a previously denied application could be resubmitted and approved by a different adjudicator. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Information systems were not easily accessible to all adjudicators, so these systems were generally not queried as part of the adjudication process. <mask_1>. In one case, the lack of communication and unclear policies and procedures had tragic consequences. In January 1999, police in Texas obtained a warrant for the arrest of Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, the \u201crailway killer\u201d who traveled around the United States by freight train and committed murders near railroad lines. In early 1999 police contacted INS Investigations staff in Houston Texas several times about placing a \u201cborder lookout\u201d for Resendez-Ramirez in case he was apprehended at the border. <mask_1>. The Investigations staff also failed to enter a lookout in IDENT in case Resendez-Ramirez was apprehended trying to cross the border. On June 1, 1999, the Border Patrol apprehended Resendez-Ramirez trying to cross illegally and had him processed through the IDENT system. Because no border lookout had been placed, however, the Border Patrol voluntarily returned him to Mexico in accordance with standard Border Patrol practices. He subsequently returned illegally to the United States and committed four more murders before he was captured. <mask_1>. They never received any IDENT training. They were unaware IDENT had a lookout feature. They thought IDENT was a system primarily for the Border Patrol to use. <mask_1>. INS failed to (1) (1) ensure that components outside of the Border Patrol, such as Investigations, understood IDENT policies, particularly the lookout policy and (2) provide adequate IDENT training for all INS staff. INS and the FBI are currently working on integrating IDENT with the FBI\u2019s automated fingerprint system to improve the quality and accuracy of criminal identification so that such mistakes can be averted in the future. Effective communication has also been a problem between INS and local communities. In August 2001, we reported that since 1994 as INS\u2019 Border Patrol has increased enforcement efforts in certain locations as part of its strategy to deter illegal entry along the southwest border, illegal alien traffic shifted to other locations. Officials from some border communities told us that they were caught by surprise by the increase in the number of illegal aliens apprehended in their communities. INS has recognized the need to improve communications with the public regarding its strategy and its potential implications and has increased its outreach efforts. INS has had long-standing difficulty developing and fielding information systems to support its program operations. <mask_1>. We also reported that INS had not conducted a comprehensive agency-wide information needs assessment. As a result, program and management data were kept in a loose collection of automated systems as well as a number of ad-hoc labor-intensive manual systems. Effectively using information technology continues to remain a challenge for INS. In August 2000, we reported that INS did not have a \u201cblueprint\u201d to guide the development of its information systems. The absence of such a plan increases the risk that the information systems in which hundreds of millions of dollars are invested each year will not be well integrated or compatible and will not support mission needs. In December 2000, we reported that INS had limited capability to effectively manage its planned and ongoing information technology investments. While INS has some important information technology management capabilities in place, it has to do considerable work to fully implement mature and effective processes. The Department of Justice agreed with our recommendation that INS develop and submit a plan to Justice for implementing investment management process improvements. INS is in the process of developing this plan. The lack of adequate information technology systems has significantly impacted INS\u2019 ability to perform its core missions. <mask_1>. INS has no national case management system for applications filed at its 33 district offices. Most of these offices process applications manually. As a result, these offices cannot determine the number of pending cases, identify problem areas or bottlenecks, establish processing priorities, deploy staff based on workload, and ensure cases are processed in the order received. Due to the lack of any automated system, staff spend considerable time responding to applicants\u2019 inquires on the status of their case, which takes time away from application processing. <mask_1>. In our applications processing report we stated that the system INS Service Centers use to process some applications frequently fails to operate and does not always update data to INS\u2019 mainframe computer as it should. This lack of automation has resulted in INS expending considerable time and effort to obtain the data it needs. In our applications processing report we also stated that lack of reliable data was the primary reason INS undertook a time-consuming and costly hand-count of all pending applications in September 2000. INS undertook the hand-count to get an accurate count of pending applications hoping to obtain an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2000 financial statements. <mask_1>. INS suspended nearly all case processing for 2-3 weeks. Due to the lack of accurate data in its computer systems, INS will have to do another hand-count of all pending applications at the end of fiscal year 2001 if it hopes to obtain an unqualified opinion on its financial statement. As a result of this lack of accurate data, INS has also approved more visas than the Congress has allowed. According to an INS contractor study, INS\u2019 system that tracks these visas was not designed to keep a running total of the number of visas issued and to compare it against the annual limit to ensure that only the allowable number is approved. Consequently, in fiscal year 1999, INS approved approximately 137,000 to 138,000 H-1B visas, well over the 115,000 limit. Program management issues at INS have caused continuing concern. Our work indicates that INS needs to improve its program management in several fundamental areas, including having efficient processes and clear policies and procedures, providing adequate staff training, and aligning its workforce with its workload. The INS contractor study on immigration benefits processing found that INS\u2019 processes were inefficient. <mask_1>. INS did not consistently adjudicate applications because the procedures used to process applications varied by office, most field offices allowed adjudicators to review cases using minimal guidelines, and standard quality controls were lacking. The study made numerous recommendations on how to make the processes more efficient and improve quality control. We stated in our applications processing report that INS was developing a strategic plan to reengineer applications processing. INS will make decisions regarding the contractor\u2019s recommendations after completing two related strategic plans - the plan to reengineer applications processing and the information technology strategic plan. Both are in the early planning stages. INS estimated that it will take 5 years or more to develop and implement the reengineered processes and implement a service-wide automated system to process applications. Adequate staff training is also a critical aspect of program management. <mask_1>. According to a November 2000 INS report prepared as part of INS\u2019 Government Performance and Results Act reporting requirements, the INS workforce is not well supported in terms of training. Advanced training classes have been cut back or delayed. According to the report, because of the growing workforce and these training cutbacks, INS will have a larger portion of its workforce that is relatively inexperienced and inadequately trained for its work.", "labels": ". In 1991, we reported that, historically, INS leadership had allowed INS\u2019 organizational structure to become decentralized without adequate controls. Specifically, its regional structure had created geographical separation among INS programs and hampered resource allocation and consistent program implementation. In addition, only a single senior INS headquarters manager supervised INS\u2019 33 district directors and 21 Border Patrol chiefs. In 1994, with the appointment of a new Commissioner, INS implemented an organizational structure intended to remedy at least two problems. While INS made some progress toward achieving its reorganization goals, its organizational structure is still in a state of flux and some problems persist. We recommended, among other things, that the INS Commissioner provide written guidance on (1) the responsibilities and authorities of these two offices and (2) the appropriate coordination and communication methods between these two offices, and between the Office of Programs and field offices. Although INS has taken some steps to implement our 1997 recommendations, they have yet to be completed because, according to INS, these recommendations relate to INS restructuring that is currently under study. The performance appraisal process for staff that evaluates the merits of applications filed with INS (called adjudicators) focused mainly on the number of applications reviewed, not the quality of the review. INS rewarded those adjudicators who processed the greatest number of applications over those who processed fewer applications. In our May 2001 report on INS application processing, we stated that INS\u2019 policy is to grant work authorization to applicants who file for adjustment of status to that of a permanent resident before it adjudicates their application. This policy is intended to prevent aliens from having to wait for INS to adjudicate their application before they can work. Because these aliens had work authorization while waiting for their application to be processed, they could have developed a work history that may have facilitated their obtaining employment even after INS\u2019 efforts to officially revoke their work authorization. A senior INS official stated that the policy to grant work authorization before the adjustment of status application is decided is intended to be fair to the majority of adjustment of status applicants who are approved. An investigation into INS\u2019 initiative to process naturalization applications more quickly found the initiative to be fraught with quality and integrity problems resulting in ineligible applicants receiving citizenship. According to a Department of Justice Office of Inspector General (OIG) report on INS\u2019 Citizenship USA initiative launched in 1995, INS made the timely completion of naturalization applications its guiding principle at the expense of accuracy and quality in determining eligibility. As a result of the problems found, INS instituted naturalization quality control procedures to enhance the integrity of the process. We are finding a similar situation in our ongoing review for this subcommittee of INS\u2019 efforts to deter immigration benefit fraud. Other researchers have also found that INS had difficulty in balancing its enforcement and service delivery priorities. Although the passport numbers of the stolen Icelandic passports had been entered into a lookout database, INS airport inspectors were not entering the passport numbers of passengers arriving with Icelandic passports into the lookout database. INS officials told the OIG investigators that manually keying in these passport numbers into the system would take too long and would hamper INS\u2019 ability to inspect all passengers from a flight within 45 minutes, as mandated by law. An INS contractor that evaluated INS\u2019 immigration benefits process in 1999 found that INS needed to strengthen the integrity of the process. The study found that INS had no standard quality control program for ensuring that applications were processed consistently. As we reported in our applications processing report, despite these pressures to complete applications more quickly, INS\u2019 backlog of applications increased to about 4 million applications by the end of fiscal year 2000, a four-fold increase since 1994. As of September 30, 2001 about 767,000 applicants out of almost 3 million with pending applications had been waiting at least 21 months for INS to process their application. Over one half of the employees we surveyed in preparing that report believed that INS had poor communications and that information was disseminated poorly. INS Investigations officials told us that the autonomy of the individual units and the lack of a single chain of command to manage INS\u2019 anti-smuggling investigations were major obstacles to building a more effective anti-smuggling program. At the time of our review, INS officials told us that INS was in the process of upgrading the computer system that tracks H-1B applications, which could make more accurate and up to date information available on-line for adjudicators. Our work and the work of an INS contractor both found that INS did not have a structure in place to manage the information that adjudicators needed to make correct decisions. INS had no single repository of information where adjudicators could find the most up to date information on such things as adjudication processes and legal and regulatory policies. According to a Department of Justice OIG report, none of the Investigations staff contacted by the police thought to inform the police about the existence of IDENT, INS\u2019 automated fingerprint identification system. INS\u2019 Houston investigations staff provided OIG investigators with various reasons as to why they did not mention IDENT or its lookout capability to police or enter a lookout in IDENT, including the following: They were unfamiliar with IDENT and how it worked. The OIG concluded that the lack of knowledge about IDENT was largely the result of broader problems in the way INS implemented and monitored IDENT. In 1990, we reported that INS managers and field officials did not have adequate, reliable, and timely information to effectively carry out the Service\u2019s mission. As we reported in our applications processing report, INS headquarters and field staff cited automation problems as the number one factor affecting INS\u2019 ability to process applications in a timely manner to reduce backlogs. Existing INS systems used to process applications do not provide accurate and reliable data. According to INS officials, the cost to complete this hand-count was high in terms of lost production and staff time. For example, INS staff spends considerable time re-entering the same data into various INS computer systems. As noted earlier in our testimony, an INS contractor study found that INS adjudicators received little training in fraud detection. "}, {"inputs": "<mask_1>Whil<mask_1> TCE and perchlorate are both DOD-classified emerging contaminants, there are key distinctions between the contaminants that affect the extent to which they are regulated, and the information that may be needed before further steps are taken to protect human health and the environment. <mask_1>ince 1989, a maximum contaminant level (MCL) under the Safe Drinking Water Act has been in place for TCE. <mask_1>. We provided details about EPA\u2019s evolving standards for TCE and the evolving knowledge of its health effects in our May 2007 report and June 2007 testimony on issues related to drinking water contamination on Camp Lejeune. TCE is a colorless liquid with a sweet, chloroform-like odor that is used mainly as a degreaser for metal parts. The compound is also a component in adhesives, lubricants, paints, varnishes, paint strippers, and pesticides. At one time, TCE was used as an extraction solvent for cosmetics and drug products and as a dry-cleaning agent; however, its use for these purposes has been discontinued. DOD has used the chemical in a wide variety of industrial and maintenance processes. More recently, the department has used TCE to clean sensitive computer circuit boards in military equipment such as tanks and fixed wing aircraft. Because TCE is pervasive in the environment, most people are likely to be exposed to TCE by simply eating, drinking, and breathing, according to the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). Industrial wastewater is the primary source of release of TCE into water systems, but inhalation is the main route of potential environmental exposure to TCE. ATSDR has also reported that TCE has been found in a variety of foods, with the highest levels in meats, at 12 to 16 ppb, and U.S. margarine, at 440 to 3,600 ppb. In fact, HHS\u2019s National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) suggested that approximately 10 percent of the population had detectable levels of TCE in their blood. Inhaling small amounts of TCE may cause headaches, lung irritation, poor coordination, and difficulty concentrating, according ATSDR\u2019s Toxicological Profile. Inhaling or drinking liquids containing high levels of TCE may cause nervous system effects, liver and lung damage, abnormal heartbeat, coma, or possibly death. ATSDR also notes that some animal studies suggest that high levels of TCE may cause liver, kidney, or lung cancer, and some studies of people exposed over long periods to high levels of TCE in drinking water or workplace air have shown an increased risk of cancer. ATSDR\u2019s Toxicological Profile notes that the National Toxicology Program has determined that TCE is \u201creasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\u201d and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has determined that TCE is probably carcinogenic to humans\u2014 specifically, kidney, liver and cervical cancers, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, and non- Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma\u2014based on limited evidence of carcinogenicity in humans and additional evidence from studies in experimental animals. Effective in 1989, EPA adopted an MCL of 5 ppb of TCE in drinking water supplies pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act. Despite EPA\u2019s regulation of TCE as a drinking water contaminant, concerns over serious long-term effects associated with TCE exposures have prompted additional scrutiny by both governmental and nongovernmental scientific organizations. For example, ATSDR initiated a public health assessment in 1991 to evaluate the possible health risks from exposure to contaminated drinking water on Camp Lejeune. The health concerns over TCE have been further amplified in recent years after scientific studies have suggested additional risks posed by human exposure to TCE. ATSDR is continuing to develop information about the possible long-term health consequences of these potential exposures in a subregistry to the National Exposure Registry specifically for hazardous waste sites. As we previously reported with respect to Camp Lejeune, those who lived on base likely had a higher risk of inhalation exposure to volatile organic compounds such as TCE, which may be more potent than ingestion exposure. Thus, pregnant women who lived in areas of base housing with contaminated water and conducted activities during which they could inhale water vapor\u2014such as bathing, showering, or washing dishes or clothing\u2014likely faced greater exposure than those who did not live on base but worked on base in areas served by the contaminated drinking water. Concerns about possible adverse health effects and government actions related to the past drinking water contamination on Camp Lejeune have led to additional activities, including new health studies, claims against the federal government, and federal inquiries. As a consequence of these growing concerns\u2014and of anxiety among affected communities about these health effects and related litigation\u2014ATSDR has undertaken a study to examine whether individuals who were exposed in utero to the contaminated drinking water are more likely to have developed certain childhood cancers or birth defects. This research, once completed later in 2007, is expected to help regulators understand the effects of low levels of TCE in our environment. In addition, some former residents of Camp Lejeune have filed tort claims and lawsuits against the federal government related to the past drinking water contamination. As of June 2007, about 850 former residents and former employees had filed tort claims with the Department of the Navy related to the past drinking water contamination. According to an official with the U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General\u2014which is handling the claims on behalf of the Department of the Navy\u2014the agency is currently maintaining a database of all claims filed. The official said that the Judge Advocate General is awaiting completion of the latest ATSDR health study before deciding whether to settle or deny the pending claims in order to base its response on as much objective scientific and medical information as possible. According to DOD, any future reassessment of TCE toxicity may result in additional reviews of DOD sites that utilized the former TCE toxicity values, as the action levels for TCE cleanup in the environment may change. As we discussed in our May 2005 report and April 2007 testimony, EPA has not established a standard for limiting perchlorate concentrations in drinking water under the SDWA. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Other uses include fireworks, fertilizers, and explosives. It is readily dissolved and transported in water and has been found in groundwater, surface water, drinking water, and soil across the country. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In 2005, NRC issued a comprehensive review of the health effects of perchlorate ingestion, and it reported that certain levels of exposure may not adversely affect healthy adults. <mask_1>.<mask_1>. In 2005, the EPA adopted the NRC recommended reference dose, which translates to a drinking water equivalent level (DWEL) of 24.5 ppb. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Several human studies have shown that thyroid changes occur in human adults at significantly higher concentrations than the amounts typically observed in water supplies. However, more recent studies have since provided new knowledge and raised concerns about potential health risks of low-level exposures, particularly for infants and fetuses. Specifically, in October 2006, researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published the results of the first large study to examine the relationship between low-level perchlorate exposure and thyroid function in women with lower iodine levels. About 36 percent of U.S. women have these lower iodine levels. The study found decreases in a thyroid hormone that helps regulate the body\u2019s metabolism and is needed for proper fetal neural development. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. FDA is also planning to publish, in late 2007, an assessment of exposure to perchlorate from foods, based on results from its fiscal year 2005-2006 Total Diet Study\u2014a market basket study that is representative of the U.S. diet. Some federal funding has been directed to perchlorate studies and cleanup activities. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. As we have previously reported, DOD must comply with any cleanup standards and processes under all applicable environmental laws, regulations, and executive orders, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Clean Water Act\u2019s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), and the SDWA. <mask_1>. DOD\u2019s recognition of a substance as an emerging contaminant can lead DOD to decide to take to certain cleanup efforts even in the absence of a federal regulatory standard. <mask_1>. <mask_1>.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. (See table 1.) Massachusetts is the only state to have established a drinking water standard\u2014set at 2 ppb. The California Department of Health Services reports that California will complete the rulemaking for its proposed standard of 6 ppb later this year. States have used these thresholds to identify the level at which some specified action must be taken by DOD and other facilities in their state, in the absence of a federal standard. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. DOD is undertaking a number of activities to address emerging contaminants in general, including the creation of the Materials of Evolving Regulatory Interest Team (MERIT) to systematically address the health, environmental, and safety concerns associated with emerging contaminants. As noted above, DOD is required to follow EPA regulations for monitoring and cleanup of TCE. In addition, DOD is working with ATSDR, which has projected a December 2007 completion date for its current study of TCE\u2019s health effects on pregnant women and their children. In the absence of a federal standard, DOD has adopted its own perchlorate policies for sampling and cleanup activities or is working under applicable state guidelines. DOD created MERIT to help address the health, environmental, and safety concerns associated with emerging contaminants. <mask_1>.e.<mask_1>. MERIT\u2019s initiatives include pollution prevention, detection/analytical methods, human health studies, treatment technologies, lifecycle cost analysis, risk assessment and risk management, and public outreach. Another of MERIT\u2019s activities was to create an Emerging Contaminant Action List of materials that DOD has assessed and judged to have a significant potential impact on people or DOD\u2019s mission. <mask_1>. To be placed on the action list, the contaminant will generally have been assessed by MERIT for its impacts on (1) environment, safety, and health (including occupational and public health), (2) cleanup efforts, (3) readiness and training, (4) acquisition, and (5) operation and maintenance activities. In 1979, EPA issued nonenforceable guidance establishing \u201csuggested no adverse response levels\u201d for TCE in drinking water. These levels provided EPA\u2019s estimate of the short- and long-term exposure to TCE in drinking water for which no adverse response would be observed and described the known information about possible health risks for these chemicals. However, the guidance for TCE did not suggest actions that public water systems should take if TCE concentrations exceeded those values. Subsequently, in 1989, EPA set an enforceable MCL for TCE of 5 micrograms per liter, equivalent to 5 ppb in drinking water. The new standard served as a regulatory basis for many facilities to take concrete action to measure and control TCE. According to EPA\u2019s Region 4 Superfund Director, for example, 46 sites on Camp Lejeune have since been identified for TCE cleanup. The Navy and EPA have selected remedies for 30 of those sites, and the remaining 16 are under active investigation. The first Record of Decision was signed in September 1992 and addressed contamination of groundwater in the Hadnot Point Area, one of Camp Lejeune\u2019s water systems. Remedies to address groundwater contamination include groundwater \u201cpump and treat\u201d systems, in-situ chemical oxidation, and monitored natural attenuation. DOD contends that it is aggressively treating TCE as part of its current cleanup program. It notes that the department uses much less TCE than in the past and requires strict handling procedures and pollution prevention measures to prevent exposure to TCE and the release of TCE into the environment. Specifically, DOD has replaced products containing TCE with other types of cleaning agents such as citrus-based agents, mineral oils and other non-toxic solutions. In the absence of a federal perchlorate standard, DOD has adopted its own policies with regard to sampling and cleanup. The 2003 Interim Policy on Perchlorate Sampling required the military services\u2014Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines\u2014to sample on active installations (1) where a reasonable basis existed to suspect that a perchlorate release occurred as a result of DOD activities, and (2) a complete human exposure pathway likely existed or (3) where a particular installation must do so under state laws or applicable federal regulations such as the NPDES permit program. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In the absence of a federal standard, DOD has also worked with individual states on perchlorate sampling and cleanup. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. The new policy applies broadly to DOD\u2019s active and closed installations and formerly used defense sites within the United States, its territories and possessions. <mask_1>. The policy also acknowledges the importance of EPA direction in driving DOD\u2019s response to emerging contaminants. It stated, for example, that its adoption of 24 ppb as the current level of concern for managing perchlorate was in response to EPA\u2019s adoption of an oral reference dose that translates to a Drinking Water Equivalent Level of 24.5 ppb. <mask_1>.\u201d The 2006 policy directs DOD to test for perchlorate when it is reasonably expected that a release has occurred. <mask_1>. When an assessment indicates that the perchlorate contamination could result in adverse health effects, the site must be prioritized for risk management. DOD uses a relative-risk site evaluation framework across DOD to evaluate the risks posed by one site relative to other sites and to help prioritize environmental restoration work and to allocate resources among sites. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Through fiscal year 2006, DOD reported spending approximately $88 million on perchlorate-related research activities, including $60 million for perchlorate treatment technologies, $9.5 million on health and toxicity studies, and $11.6 million on pollution prevention. Additional funds have been spent on testing technology and cleanup. <mask_1>. For example, DOD posts the results of its perchlorate sampling, by state, on MERIT\u2019s Web site. As we have previously reported, DOD must comply with cleanup standards and processes under applicable laws, regulations and executive orders, including EPA drinking water standards and state-level standards. <mask_1>. For example, at Edwards Air Force Base in California, DOD has treated 32 million gallons of ground water under a pilot project for contaminants that include perchlorate. In addition, DOD has removed soil and treated groundwater at the Massachusetts Military Reservation and Camp Bonneville in Washington State. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, DOD faces significant challenges, and potentially large costs, in addressing emerging contaminants, particularly in light of the scientific developments and regulatory uncertainties surrounding these chemicals and materials. To help address them, DOD recently identified five emerging contaminants for which it is developing risk management options. As in the case of TCE, DOD took action to address contamination after EPA established an MCL in 1989. DOD has stated that further efforts to address perchlorate would require a regulatory standard from EPA and/or the states. The fact that some states have moved to create such standards complicates the issue for DOD by presenting it with varying cleanup standards across the country. As the debate over a federal perchlorate standard continues, the recently- issued health studies from CDC and FDA may provide additional weight to the view that the time for such a standard may be approaching. <mask_1>. Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I would be happy to respond to any questions that you or Members of the Subcommittee may have at this time.

While TCE and perchlorate are both DOD-classified emerging contaminants, there are key distinctions between the contaminants that affect the extent to which they are regulated, and the information that may be needed before further steps are taken to protect human health and the environment. e. S. In contrast, EPA has not adopted an MCL for perchlorate, although recent government- sponsored studies have raised concerns that even low-levels of exposure to perchlorate may pose serious risks to infants and fetuses of pregnant women. Perchlorate has emerged as a matter of concern because recent studies have shown that it can affect the thyroid gland, which helps to regulate the body\u2019s metabolism and may cause developmental impairments in the fetuses of pregnant women. Perchlorate is a primary ingredient in propellant and has been used for decades by the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the defense industry in manufacturing, testing, and firing missiles and rockets. The sources of perchlorate vary, but the defense and aerospace industries are the greatest known source of contamination. Scientific information on perchlorate was limited until 1997, when a better detection method became available for perchlorate, and detections (and concern about perchlorate contamination) increased. In 1998, EPA first placed perchlorate on its Contaminant Candidate List, the list of contaminants that are candidates for regulation, but the agency concluded that information was insufficient to determine whether perchlorate should be regulated under the SDWA. EPA listed perchlorate as a priority for further research on health effects and treatment technologies and for collecting occurrence data. In 1999, EPA required water systems to monitor for perchlorate under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule to determine the frequency and levels at which it is present in public water supplies nationwide. Interagency disagreements over the risks of perchlorate exposure led several federal agencies to ask the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academy of Sciences to evaluate perchlorate\u2019s health effects. However, the NRC-recommended more studies on the effects of perchlorate exposure in children and pregnant women and recommended a reference dose of 0. 0007 milligrams per kilogram per day. If the EPA were to develop a drinking water standard for perchlorate, it would adjust the DWEL to account for other sources of exposure, such as food. Although EPA has taken some steps to consider a standard, in April 2007 EPA again decided not to regulate perchlorate\u2014citing the need for additional research\u2014and kept perchlorate on its Contaminant Candidate List. Moreover, in May 2007, FDA released a preliminary exposure assessment because of significant public interest in the issue of perchlorate exposure from food. FDA sampled and tested foods such as tomatoes, carrots, spinach, and cantaloupe; and other high water content foods such as apple and orange juices; vegetables such as cucumbers, green beans, and greens; and seafood such as fish and shrimp for perchlorate and found widespread low-level perchlorate levels in these items. For example, committee reports related to the DOD and EPA appropriations acts of fiscal year 2006 directed some funding for perchlorate cleanup. In the Senate committee report for the Department of Health and Human Services fiscal year 2006 appropriations act, the committee encouraged support for studies on the long-term effects of perchlorate exposure. The Senate committee report for FDA\u2019s fiscal year 2006 appropriations act directed FDA to continue conducting surveys of perchlorate in food and bottled water and to report the findings to Congress. In the current Congress, legislation has been introduced that would require EPA to establish a health advisory for perchlorate, as well as requiring public water systems serving more than 10,000 people to test for perchlorate and disclose its presence in annual consumer confidence reports. Other pending legislation would require EPA to establish a national primary drinking water standard for perchlorate. DOD has certain responsibilities with regard to emerging contaminants such as TCE that are regulated by EPA or state governments, but its responsibilities and cleanup goals are less definite for emerging contaminants such as perchlorate that lack federal regulatory standards. DOD\u2019s designation of perchlorate as an emerging contaminant reflects the department\u2019s recognition that the chemical has a significant potential impact on people or the Department\u2019s mission. In addition, federal laws enacted in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 required DOD to conduct health studies and evaluate perchlorate found at military sites. For example, the Ronald W.  Reagan National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005 stated that the Secretary of Defense should develop a plan for cleaning up perchlorate resulting from DOD activities when the perchlorate poses a health hazard and continue evaluating identified sites. As we reported in our 2005 perchlorate report, DOD has sometimes responded at the request of EPA and state environmental authorities\u2014 which have used a patchwork of statutes, regulations, and general oversight authorities\u2014to act (or require others, including DOD, to act) when perchlorate was deemed to pose a threat to human health and the environment. For example, pursuant to its authority under the Clean Water Act\u2019s NPDES program, Texas required the Navy to reduce perchlorate levels in wastewater discharges at the McGregor Naval Weapons Industrial Reserve Plant to 4 parts per billion, the lowest level at which perchlorate could be detected. Similarly, after sampling required as part of a RCRA permit detected perchlorate, Utah officials required ATK Thiokol, an explosives and rocket fuel manufacturer, to install a monitoring well to determine the extent of perchlorate contamination at their facility and take steps to prevent additional releases of perchlorate. In addition, EPA and state officials also told us during our 2005 review that they have sometimes used their general oversight responsibilities to protect water quality and human health to investigate and sample groundwater and surface water areas for perchlorate. For example, EPA asked Patrick Air Force Base and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida, to sample groundwater for perchlorate near rocket launch sites. Previously, both installations had inventoried areas where perchlorate was suspected and conducted limited sampling. DOD officials did not find perchlorate at Patrick Air Force Base and, according to an EPA official, the Department of the Air Force said it would not conduct additional sampling at either installation until there was a federal standard for perchlorate. Finally, according to EPA, in the absence of a federal perchlorate standard, at least eight states have established nonregulatory action levels or advisories for perchlorate ranging from 1 part per billion to 51 parts per billion. For example, Oregon initiated in-depth site studies to determine the cause and extent of perchlorate contamination when concentrations of 18 ppb or greater are found. Nevada required the Kerr-McGee Chemical site in Henderson to treat groundwater and reduce perchlorate concentration releases to 18 ppb, which is Nevada\u2019s action level for perchlorate. Utah officials told us that while the state did not have a written action level for perchlorate, it may require the responsible party to undertake cleanup activities if perchlorate concentrations exceed 18 ppb. According to DOD, MERIT has focused on materials that have been or are used by DOD, or are under development for use, such as perchlorate, TCE, RDX, DNT and new explosives, naphthalene, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), hexavalent chromium (i. , chromium VI), beryllium, and nanomaterials. The current list includes five contaminants\u2014perchlorate, TCE, RDX, naphthalene, and hexavalent chromium. However, DOD\u2019s interim policy on perchlorate did not address cleanup responsibilities nor did it address contamination at closed installations. As we detailed in our previous work, DOD only sampled for perchlorate on closed installations when requested by EPA or a state agency, and only cleaned up active and closed installations when required by a specific environmental law, regulation, or program such as the environmental restoration program at formerly used defense sites. For example, at EPA\u2019s request, the U.  Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) installed monitoring wells and sampled for perchlorate at Camp Bonneville, a closed installation near Vancouver, Washington. Utah state officials also reported to us that DOD removed soil containing perchlorate at the former Wendover Air Force Base in Utah, where the Corps found perchlorate in 2004. However, as we previously reported, DOD cited reluctance to sample on or near active installations because of the lack of a federal regulatory standard for perchlorate. For example, in October 2004, DOD and California agreed to prioritize perchlorate sampling at DOD facilities in California, including identifying and prioritizing the investigation of areas on active installations and military sites (1) where the presence of perchlorate is likely based on previous and current defense-related activities and (2) near drinking water sources where perchlorate was found. In January 2006, DOD updated its policy with the issuance of its Policy on DOD Required Actions Related to Perchlorate. It directs DOD to test for perchlorate and take certain cleanup actions. The policy also states that when EPA or the states adopt standards for perchlorate, \u201cDOD will comply with applicable state or federal promulgated standards whichever is more stringent. If perchlorate levels exceed 24 ppb, a site-specific risk assessment must be conducted. The policy also directs DOD\u2019s service components to program resources to address perchlorate contamination under four DOD programs\u2014 environmental restoration, operational ranges, DOD-owned drinking water systems, and DOD wastewater effluent discharges. Under the 2006 perchlorate policy, DOD has sampled drinking water, groundwater, and soil where the release of perchlorate may result in human exposure and responded where it has deemed appropriate to protect public health. As we have reported, DOD is responsible for a large number of identified sites with perchlorate contamination, and the department has allotted significant resources to address the problem. According to DOD, sampling for perchlorate has occurred at 258 active DOD installations or facilities. DOD also claims credit for other efforts, including strict handling procedures to prevent the release of perchlorate into the environment and providing information about perchlorate at DOD facilities and DOD\u2019s responses. In the absence of a federal perchlorate standard, DOD has also initiated perchlorate response actions to clean up perchlorate contamination at several active and formerly used defense sites under its current perchlorate policy. Until one is adopted, DOD will continue to face the challenges of differing regulatory requirements in different states and continuing questions about whether its efforts to control perchlorate contamination are necessary or sufficient to protect human health.

Table 1 illustrates the estimated cost savings associated with each redesign area. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Figure 2 shows the timeline for planned 2020 Census research and testing. <mask_1>. This is being undertaken through an enterprise-wide IT initiative called Census Enterprise Data Collection and Processing (CEDCAP). <mask_1>. <mask_1>. For example: To reengineer field work, CEDCAP is expected to implement a new dynamic operational control system to track and manage field work. This system is to be able to make decisions about which visits enumerators should attempt on a daily basis using real-time data, as well as provide automated route planning to make enumerator travel more efficient. CEDCAP also includes testing the use of mobile devices, either government-furnished or employee-owned, to automate data collection in the field. To maximize self-response with the Internet response option, CEDCAP is responsible for developing and testing a web-based survey application and exploring options for establishing the IT infrastructure to support the increased volume of data processing and storage that will be needed. CEDCAP consists of 12 projects that are to deliver capabilities incrementally, over the course of at least 10 releases. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. As of August 2015, the CEDCAP program was projected to cost about $548 million through 2020. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Specifically, with preparations for end-to-end testing less than 2 years away, the window to implement CEDCAP, which is intended to be the backbone of the 2020 Census, is narrow. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. The Bureau has not prioritized key IT-related decisions, which is a trend we have reported for the past few years. <mask_1>. In particular, the Bureau had not completed the necessary plans and schedules for research and testing efforts and had not prioritized what needed to be done in time for the 2015 design decisions\u2014a milestone that had already been pushed back by a year (see fig. 3). We concluded that, given the current trajectory and the lack of supporting schedules and plans, it was unlikely that all planned IT-related research and testing activities would be completed in time to support the 2015 design decisions\u2014which ultimately came to fruition (as discussed later). In light of these ongoing challenges, we recommended in our April 2014 report that the Bureau prioritize its IT-related research and testing projects that need to be completed to support the design decisions and develop schedules and plans to reflect the new prioritized approach. The Bureau agreed with our recommendations and has taken steps to address them. For example, in September 2014, the Bureau released a plan that identified inputs, such as research questions, design components, and testing, that were needed to inform the operational design decisions expected in the fall of 2015. However, as we reported in February 2015, the Bureau had not yet determined how key IT research questions that had been identified as critical inputs into the design decisions\u2014estimating the Internet self- response rate and determining the IT infrastructure for security and scalability needed to support Internet response\u2014were to be answered. We therefore recommended that the Bureau, among other things, develop methodologies and plans for answering key IT-related research questions in time to inform key design decisions. While the recent 2020 Census Operational Plan documents many key IT- related decisions about the redesign of the census, other critical questions, including the ones identified in our February 2015 report, remain unanswered. Of greater concern, the Bureau does not intend to answer these and other questions until 2016 through 2018. Specifically, there are several significant IT decisions that are being deferred, which have implications on the CEDCAP program\u2019s ability to have production- ready systems in place in time to conduct end-to-end testing. <mask_1>. Figure 4 illustrates several key IT-related decisions that have been deferred which will impact preparations for the end-to-end test and 2020 Census. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. However, in September 2012, we reported that the Bureau lacked a sufficiently mature IT governance process to ensure that investments are properly controlled and monitored, did not have a comprehensive system development methodology, and continued to have long-standing challenges in requirements management. We made several recommendations to address these issues, and the Bureau took actions to fully implement each of the recommendations. For example, the Bureau addressed gaps in policies and procedures related to IT governance, such as establishing guidelines on the frequency of investment review board meetings and thresholds for escalation of cost, risk, or impact issues; finalized its adoption of an enterprise system development life-cycle methodology, which included the short incremental development model, referred to as Agile, and a process for continuously improving the methodology based on lessons learned; and implemented a consistent requirements development tool that includes guidance for developing requirements at the strategic mission, business, and project levels and is integrated with its enterprise system development life-cycle methodology. As a result, the Bureau has established a consistent process for managing and overseeing its IT investments. Effective workforce planning is essential to ensure organizations have the proper skills, abilities, and capacity for effective management. <mask_1>. In September 2012 we reported, among other things, that the Bureau had not developed a Bureau-wide IT workforce plan; identified gaps in mission-critical IT occupations, skills, and competencies; or developed strategies to address gaps. Accordingly, we recommended that the Bureau establish a repeatable process for performing IT skills assessments and gap analyses and establish a process for directorates to coordinate on IT workforce planning. In response, in 2013 the Bureau completed an enterprise-wide competency assessment and identified several mission-critical gaps in technical competencies. In 2014, the Bureau established documents to institutionalize a strategic workforce planning process, identified actions and targets to close the competency gaps by December 2015, and established a process to monitor quarterly status reports on the implementation of these actions. However, as we reported in February 2015, while these are positive steps in establishing strategic workforce planning capabilities, the Bureau\u2019s workforce competency assessment identified several mission-critical gaps that would challenge its ability to deliver IT-related initiatives, such as the IT systems that are expected to be delivered by CEDCAP. For example, the Bureau found that competency gaps existed in cloud computing, security integration and engineering, enterprise/mission engineering life- cycle, requirements development, and Internet data collection. <mask_1>. The Bureau has taken steps to regularly monitor and report on the status of its efforts to close competency gaps and has completed several notable actions. For example, in August 2015, the Bureau filled the position of Decennial IT Division Chief and in September 2015 awarded an enterprise-wide IT services contract for systems engineering and integration support. However, more work remains for the Bureau to close competency gaps critical to the implementation of its IT efforts. Most significantly, in July 2015, the Chief Information Officer resigned. As of October 2015, the Bureau was working to fill that gap and had an acting Chief Information Officer temporarily in the position. Additionally, there are other gaps in key positions, such as the Chief of the Office of Information Security and Deputy Chief Information Security Officer, Big Data Center Chief, Chief Cloud Architect, and the CEDCAP Assistant Chief of Business Integration, who is responsible for overseeing the integration of schedule, risks, and budget across the 12 projects. <mask_1>. Critical to the Bureau\u2019s ability to perform its data collection and analysis duties are its information systems and the protection of the information they contain. <mask_1>. To ensure the reliability of their computerized information, agencies should design and implement controls to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computing resources, programs, information, and facilities. Inadequate design or implementation of access controls increases the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, and destruction of sensitive information and disruption of service. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We attributed these weaknesses to the fact that the Bureau had not fully implemented a comprehensive information security program, and made 115 recommendations aimed at addressing these deficiencies. The Bureau expressed broad agreement with the report and said it would work to find the best ways to address our recommendations. As of October 29, 2015, the Bureau had addressed 66 of the 115 recommendations we made in January 2013. Of the remaining open recommendations, we have determined that 30 require additional actions by the Bureau, and for the other 19 we have work under way to evaluate if they have been fully addressed. The Bureau\u2019s progress toward addressing our security recommendations is encouraging. However, more work remains to address the recommendations. A cyber incident recently occurred at the Bureau, and while it appears to have had limited impact, it demonstrates vulnerabilities at the Bureau. Specifically, in July 2015, the Bureau reported that it had been targeted by a cyber attack aimed at gaining access to its Federal Audit Clearinghouse, which contains non-confidential information from state and local governments, nonprofit organizations, and Indian tribes to facilitate oversight of federal grant awards. <mask_1>.S.<mask_1>. <mask_1>.g.<mask_1>. As a result of the Bureau\u2019s challenges in key IT internal controls and its looming deadline, we identified CEDCAP as an IT investment in need of attention in our February 2015 High-Risk report. We recently initiated a review of the CEDCAP program for your subcommittees, and expect to issue a report in the spring of 2016. In conclusion, the Bureau is pursuing initiatives to significantly reform its outdated and inefficient methods of conducting decennial censuses. However, with less than 2 years remaining until the Bureau plans to have all systems and processes for the 2020 Census developed and ready for end-to-end testing, it faces challenges that pose significant risk to 2020 Census program. These include the magnitude of the planned changes to the design of the census, the Bureau\u2019s prior track record in executing large-scale IT projects, and the current lack of a permanent Chief Information Officer, among others. Moreover, the Bureau\u2019s preliminary decision deadline has come and gone, and many IT-related decisions have been deferred to 2016 through 2018. Consequently, it is running out of time to develop, acquire, and implement the production systems it will need to deliver the redesign and achieve its projected $5.2 billion in cost savings. The Bureau needs to take action to address the specific challenges we have highlighted in prior reports. If these actions are not taken, cost overruns, schedules delays, and performance shortfalls may diminish the potentially significant cost savings that the Bureau estimates will result from redesigning the census for 2020. Chairmen Meadows and Hurd, Ranking Members Connolly and Kelly, and Members of the Subcommittees, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have.

C. g. S. To help save costs, in preparing for the 2020 Census, the Bureau has been researching and testing new methods and technologies to redesign the Census to more cost-effectively count the population while maintaining high-quality results. The Bureau\u2019s research and testing has focused on four redesign areas: Reengineering address canvassing: This involves reengineering processes for updating the Bureau\u2019s address list and maps of the nation to reduce the need for employing field staff to walk every street in the nation to verify addresses. As we have previously reported, to deliver the Internet response option, the Bureau would need to, among other things, design and develop an Internet response application, develop and acquire the IT infrastructure to support a large volume of data processing and storage, and plan communication and outreach strategies to motivate households to respond via the Internet. My colleague will address the Bureau\u2019s progress on using administrative records in his statement today. The Bureau has conducted several major field tests to examine the potential for each of these redesign areas: In mid-2014 the Bureau conducted the 2014 Census Test in the Maryland and Washington, D. , areas to test new methods for conducting self-response and non-response follow-up. In early 2015 the Bureau completed the Address Validation Test, which was used to examine new methods for updating the Bureau\u2019s address list. In mid-2015 the Bureau conducted the 2015 Census Test in Arizona to test, among other things, the use of a field operations management system to automate data collection operations and provide real-time data and the ability to reduce the non-response follow-up workload using data previously provided to the government, as well as enabling enumerators to use their personally owned mobile devices to collect census data. Also in mid-2015, the Bureau conducted an optimizing self-response test in Savannah, Georgia, and the surrounding area, which was intended to further explore methods of encouraging households to respond using the Internet, such as using advertising and outreach to motivate respondents, and enabling households to respond without a Bureau-issued identification number. More recently, the Bureau began its National Content Test, which is currently ongoing and intended to, among other things, continue to test self-response modes and contact strategies and refine estimates of national self-response and Internet response rates. As part of these decisions, the Bureau has committed to aspects of the 2020 Census redesign. As of October 6, 2015, the Bureau had made decisions for about 47 percent of them related to each of the four redesign areas. For example, the Bureau has decided to conduct 100 percent of address canvassing (i. , identifying all addresses where people could live) in the office, and target a subset of up to 25 percent for in-the-field address canvassing; offer an Internet self-response option, as well as alternative response options via telephone and paper for limited circumstances; allow people to respond without a unique census identification use mobile devices for enumerators to conduct field data collection; use administrative records to enumerate vacant units; use enterprise solutions to support the 2020 Census, when practicable; and reduce the field footprint by half in comparison to the 2010 Census (e. , 6 regional census centers instead of 12 and up to 250 field offices instead of nearly 500). Figure 1 provides an overview of the Bureau\u2019s current plans and assumptions for the 2020 Census, resulting from the October 2015 operational plan. As a result of these decisions, the Bureau estimates saving $5. 2 billion. Specifically, the Bureau estimated that repeating the design of the 2010 Census for 2020 would cost approximately $17. 8 billion (in constant 2020 dollars), while successfully implementing the four redesign areas is expected to result in an overall 2020 Census cost of $12. 5 billion (in constant 2020 dollars). Moving forward, the Bureau plans to conduct additional research and testing and further refine the design through 2018. By August 2017, the Bureau plans to begin preparations for end-to-end testing, which is intended to test all systems and operations to ensure readiness for the 2020 Census. Concurrent with redesigning the decennial census, the Bureau has also begun a significant effort to modernize and consolidate its survey data collection and processing functions. This initiative is a large and complex modernization program intended to deliver a system-of-systems for all the Bureau\u2019s survey data collection and processing functions\u2014rather than continuing to rely on unique, survey-specific systems with redundant capabilities. For the 2020 Census, CEDCAP is expected to deliver the systems and IT infrastructure needed to implement the Bureau\u2019s redesign areas. The Bureau plans to roll out capabilities for the 2020 Census incrementally through 6 of these releases, while also deploying capabilities for other surveys such as the American Community Survey and Economic Census. The Bureau expects to reuse selected systems, make modifications to other systems, and develop or acquire additional systems and infrastructure. However, the Bureau\u2019s past efforts to implement new approaches and systems have not always gone well. As one example, during the 2010 Census, the Bureau planned to use handheld mobile devices to support field data collection for the census, including following up with nonrespondents. However, due to significant problems identified during testing of the devices, cost overruns, and schedule slippages, the Bureau decided not to use the handheld devices for non-response follow-up and reverted to paper-based processing, which increased the cost of the 2010 Census by up to $3 billion and significantly increased its risk as it had to switch its operations to paper-based operations as a backup. Last month\u2019s issuance of the 2020 Census Operational Plan, which documents many key decisions about the redesign of the 2020 Census, represents progress; however, the Bureau faces critical challenges in delivering the IT systems needed to support the redesign areas. Additionally, while the Bureau has demonstrated improvements in IT management, as we have previously reported, it faces critical gaps in its IT workforce planning and information security. Until it takes actions we have previously recommended to address these challenges, the Bureau is at risk of cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls, which will likely diminish the potentially significant cost savings that it estimates will result from redesigning the census for 2020. Specifically, in April 2014, we reported the Bureau had not prioritized key IT research and testing needed for the design decisions planned for the end of 2015. For example, the Bureau does not plan to decide on the projected demand that the IT infrastructure and systems would need to accommodate or whether the Bureau will build or buy the needed systems until June 2016, at the earliest; the high-level design and description of the systems (referred to as the solutions architecture) until September 2016\u2014leaving about a year to, among other things, build or acquire, integrate, and test the systems that are intended to serve as the backbone to the 2020 Census before preparations for end-to-end testing begins in August 2017; and the strategy for the use of mobile devices for field work until October 2017. Unless the Bureau makes these key decisions soon, it will likely run out of time to put CEDCAP systems in place. Institutionalizing key IT management controls, such as IT governance, system development methodology, and requirements management processes, helps establish a consistent and repeatable process for managing and overseeing IT investments and reduces the risk of experiencing cost overruns, schedule slippages, and performance shortfalls, like those that affected the previous census. While the Bureau has made progress in IT workforce planning efforts, many critical IT competency gaps remain to be filled. The Bureau also found that enterprise-level competency gaps existed in program and project management, budget and cost estimation, systems development, data analytics, and shared services. According to Bureau officials, they are working to address these gaps. A data breach could result in the public\u2019s loss of confidence in the Bureau, thus affecting its ability to collect census data. In January 2013, we reported on the Bureau\u2019s implementation of information security controls to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and systems that support its mission. We concluded that the Bureau had a number of weaknesses in controls intended to limit access to its systems and information, as well as those related to managing system configurations and unplanned events. According to Bureau officials, the breach was limited to this database on a segmented portion of the Bureau\u2019s network that does not touch administrative records or sensitive respondent data protected under Title 13 of the U.  Code, and the hackers did not obtain the personally identifiable information of census and survey respondents. Given that the Bureau is planning to build or acquire IT systems to collect the public\u2019s personal information for the 2020 Census in ways that it has not for previous censuses (e. , web-based surveys, cloud computing, and enabling mobile devices to collect census data), continuing to implement our recommendations and apply IT security best practices as it implements CEDCAP systems must be a high priority.

LMP has information on the location and quantity of all items in the CAD stockpile, but some records have incomplete or incorrect data on condition and weight. Further, according to DOD officials, each item has a condition code assigned to it by the service when placed into the CAD stockpile, and the condition code is not updated while the item is in the Service officials stated that when they are considering pulling stockpile.an item from the stockpile to fill a current need, they generally inspect the condition of the item to determine whether the condition code of the item is still accurate and the item is useable. <mask_1>. Further, we found that DOD does not have the weight data for a number of items in the CAD stockpile. Federal Government state that an entity should have controls to ensure that all transactions are complete and accurately recorded. In our review of data in the LMP database from 2012 to February 2015 the number of records without assigned weight increased from 2,223 (out of 34,511 records) to 2,829 (out of 36,355 records), which shows the problem is growing. Although some of the records that are missing weight data have very few items in storage, there are several items with significant quantities, such as 3.8 million of chaff countermeasures, 125,000 of 75 millimeter projectiles, and 109,000 of 155 millimeter ammunition. <mask_1>. Pro-weight is used because the demilitarization process has to recycle, or otherwise dispose of all packaging material and containers in addition to destroying the ammunition. The CAD stockpile weights are described in short tons, which is equal to 2,000 lbs. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. The absence of weight data for some of the items in the CAD stockpile understates the size and composition of the CAD stockpile, thereby affecting DOD\u2019s estimations of its demilitarization needs. <mask_1>. DOD officials stated they are trying to correct current records with missing or inaccurate data, particularly weight. In some cases, such as older stocks, the only solution is to locate and physically weigh the ammunition item(s). DOD officials have not weighed the items because they said it would be costly and labor intensive. However, since the items without weight data are not factored into DOD\u2019s demilitarization determination, DOD is not positioned to optimally demilitarize the most ammunition possible with the given resources available. Further, as discussed above, the number of records without weight data has increased over the years, which indicates that SMCA continues to accept materiel into the CAD stockpile without weight data. <mask_1>. Specifically, the military services have achieved benefits such as cost avoidances from access to the information in LMP on the CAD stockpile. For example, an Air Force need for 280,000 rounds of 40 millimeter ammunition was met by the remanufacture of Navy 40 millimeter shells drawn from the CAD stockpile, which according to Joint Munitions Command officials saved an estimated $30 million. Also, the Marine Corps identified the need for signal flares at security check points in Iraq and Afghanistan, so they pulled 95,594 flares out of the CAD stockpile, which according to Marine Corps officials saved the service an estimated $3.8 million. <mask_1>. DOD also has reduced its demilitarization costs by transferring some excess ammunition to other government agencies as opposed to demilitarizing the ammunition, but has made such transfers only on a limited basis. For example, in fiscal year 2014 DOD provided 38 million rounds of small arms ammunition to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and 7.5 million rounds of small arms ammunition to the U.S. Marshals Service. <mask_1>. Recognizing that there are benefits to such transfers, the Office of the Executive Director for Conventional Ammunition, in its Fiscal Year 2014 Cross-Leveling End of Year Report, included remarks indicating efforts should be made to include other government agencies in the cross-leveling process. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. According to officials, DOD does not have a formal process for offering the excess small arms ammunition and components to other government agencies. This manual references 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2576a, under which DOD is permitted to transfer (sell or donate) ammunition to federal or state agencies where the Secretary of Defense determines that the ammunition is \u201c(A) suitable for use by the agencies in law enforcement activities, including counter-drug and counter-terrorism activities; and (B) excess to the needs of the Department of Defense.\u201d The ammunition must also be part of the existing stock of DOD, accepted by the recipient agency on an as-is, where-is basis, transferred without the expenditure of any funds available to DOD for the procurement of defense equipment, and transferred such that all costs incurred subsequent to the transfer of the property are borne or reimbursed by the recipient agency. Finally, there is a stated preference for those applications indicating that the transferred property will be used in counter-drug or counter-terrorism activities of the recipient agency. training and qualification requirements. However, due to budget constraints the Department of Homeland Security reduced the number of training classes. <mask_1>. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should ensure there are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining information from, external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving its goals. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Some of the demilitarization processes generate additional environmental hazards, such as air pollutants and waste water. Figure 2 shows the release of air pollutants from the open burning of munitions. Other demilitarization processes, such as open detonation, generate noise pollution affecting the local community. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. However, officials stated there are environmental concerns with open burn/open detonation that may force DOD to use alternate and more costly methods of disposal, like closed disposal technology, in the future. For example, officials at one demilitarization facility noted that they generally operated their open detonation demolition ranges at less than 50 percent of capacity (weight of explosive charge) due to air and noise pollution concerns. According to DOD officials, DOD works to ensure compliance with various environmental regulations by applying for and maintaining permits issued by federal and state agencies that regulate its demilitarization operations. Officials indicated that these permits are granted by federal and state agencies and specify which pollutants can be released and in what quantities, as well as describe in detail how each process controls pollutants and meets applicable standards. If environmental regulations change, DOD officials indicated they may need to renew their permits; if the permits are revised, DOD may be required to fund capital investments in equipment and processes to conform to the requirements of any new permits. SMCA officials stated they address these challenges by including in each annual demilitarization plan sufficient work for each depot to exercise existing environmental permits so the permits do not lapse. Also, they recycle or remanufacture, when possible, materiel that otherwise would be destroyed. Finally, the officials indicated that they contract with private companies to conduct some of the demilitarization work as well. Treaty Compliance: The U.S. government is considering two treaties that, if ratified, would significantly impact U.S. demilitarization operations. One treaty is the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the other is the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction. DOD has an inventory of 471,726 tons of cluster munitions and 23,436 tons of anti-personnel landmines that will have to be disposed of if the United States ratifies the two treaties. Specifically, the conventions require the destruction of the respective cluster munitions and landmines inventories, and to comply, DOD officials stated that they would be forced to prioritize disposal of these weapons without concern to maximizing the reduction of the CAD stockpile. Service Forecasts: SMCA officials said that DOD\u2019s demilitarization budget request frequently does not match actual funding needs. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. However, program officials indicate the services\u2019 forecasts are generally inaccurate, which can make demilitarization planning challenging. In 2010, the Army Audit Agency found that Army officials had significantly understated the forecasted annual additions the services would transfer to the CAD stockpile from 2005 to March 2009, and these estimates were based on the projections furnished by the services. The Army Audit Agency recommended the Joint Conventional Ammunition Policies and Procedures 7 (Demilitarization and Disposal) be revised to help the military services develop better forecasts for additions to the stockpile. In their 2013 follow-up report, the Army Audit Agency found that the Joint Conventional Ammunition Policies and Procedures 7 (Demilitarization and Disposal) had been revised in 2011; however, the forecast additions for fiscal year 2012 were still inaccurate. SMCA officials told us that they still received inaccurate forecast information from the services. The SMCA officials stated they have no control over the ammunition the services actually transfer year to year, and they accept all excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition into the CAD stockpile, even if it exceeds forecasts. DOD officials stated they do not have options to address any problems caused by unplanned additions to the CAD stockpile, although DOD recalculates the demilitarization plan to include the additional ammunition when appropriate. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Further, the report stated that the conventional ammunition demilitarization program is considered a lower priority when compared to other needs. <mask_1>. Officials stated that the amount of funding has caused them to be reluctant to initiate projects that increase demilitarization capacity or efficiency, since these capabilities may not be utilized in the future due to funding shortfalls. Furthermore, officials state they lack Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation (RDT&E) funding to develop demilitarization processes for the disposal of some materiel in the CAD stockpile that cannot be demilitarized using current processes, but they expect these funds will be increased in fiscal year 2017. SMCA addresses the funding challenge each year by developing an annual demilitarization plan to dispose of as much of the CAD stockpile as it can based on the amount of funding they receive. DOD officials have estimated the average cost to store, maintain, and dispose of excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. This cost is driven by the quantities and the complexity of the items being demilitarized. DOD has not conducted a formal analysis comparing the costs of storing excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition with the costs of its demilitarization and disposal. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Further, DOD officials stated their mission is to demilitarize all conventional ammunition in the CAD stockpile and the annual decisions on what to demilitarize are based on achieving that goal. For information on how SMCA officials determine what conventional ammunition to demilitarize, see appendix IV. Efficient management of the CAD stockpile and DOD\u2019s demilitarization effort is important to ensure that as much hazardous material is disposed of as possible using the resources available. <mask_1>. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that an entity should have controls to ensure that all transactions are complete and accurately recorded. <mask_1>. Without complete and accurate data, DOD is not well positioned to make the best demilitarization decisions and to use demilitarization resources as efficiently as possible. Furthermore, efficient management of the CAD stockpile is not solely a matter of demilitarization, since some materiel in it potentially could be transferred to other agencies, in keeping with DOD regulations and statutory requirements. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. To improve the efficiency of DOD\u2019s conventional demilitarization efforts, including systematically collecting and maintaining key information about the items in its CAD stockpile and sharing information on excess items with other government agencies, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to take the following two actions. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix V, DOD concurred with both of the recommendations. DOD also provided technical comments on the draft report, which we incorporated as appropriate. <mask_1>. DOD stated that Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics would ensure that the Secretary of the Army is tasked to identify and record, to the extent practicable, weight data for the existing CAD stockpile and for items transferred to the CAD stockpile in the future. <mask_1>. We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Defense; the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; and the Commandant of the Marine Corps. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff has any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-5257 or merrittz@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff members who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix VI. <mask_1>. Additionally, depots have used the policies and guidance to develop their own implementing guidance and standard operating procedures for use at their locations. For example, Tooele Army Depot developed a letter of instruction for the inspection and disposal of inert material and Crane Army Ammunition Plant has developed several standard operating procedures to govern the base\u2019s demilitarization processes. The table below provides an overview of key DOD policies on demilitarization. DOD Instruction 5025.01, DOD Issuances Program, establishes guidance for directives, instructions, manuals, and charters such as frequency of updates, length, purpose, and appropriate approval level. The guidance documents we reviewed in the table above conform to the requirements under DOD Instruction 5025.01: DOD Instruction 5025.01 provides that directives, instructions, and manuals (issuances) published before March 25, 2012 should be updated or cancelled within 10 years of their publication date, and that those published or changed after that date will be processed for cancellation by the Directives Division on the 10-year anniversary of their original publication dates, unless an extension is approved. That said, even for those issuances not required to be cancelled within 10 years, an issuance is not considered current when it is not within 10 years of its publication date. The directives, instructions and manuals we reviewed in the table above conformed to this requirement. For example, DOD Directive 5160.65, Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) was published on August 1, 2008. Therefore, it is not required to be updated or cancelled until August 2018. DOD Instruction 5025.01 provides that directives should not be more than 10 pages in length (including enclosures, with no procedures, and with the exception of charters); instructions not more than 50 pages (including enclosures) or they should be divided into volumes; and manuals should be divided into two or more volumes if more than 100 pages are required. The directives, instructions, and manuals we reviewed in the table above were within the established parameters. <mask_1>.68 is 21 pages, which is within the required maximum limit of 50 pages for instructions not divided into multiple volumes. DOD Instruction 5025.01 requires that DOD directives exclusively establish policy, assign responsibility, and delegate authority to the DOD Components. Directives will not contain procedures. DOD instructions either implement policy or establish policy and assign responsibilities, and may provide general procedures for carrying out or implementing those policies. DOD manuals provide detailed procedures for implementing policy established in instructions and directives. The directives, instructions, and manuals we reviewed in the table above established and implemented policy as required. For example, DOD Instruction 5160.<mask_1>. DOD Instruction 5025.01 states that, generally, directives are to be signed by the Secretary of Defense or Deputy Secretary of Defense. Depending on the nature of the instruction, instructions must be signed by the component head in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, his or her Principal Deputy, or Office of the Secretary of Defense Presidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed official. Manuals must be signed by an individual in one of these positions, as authorized by their chartering directives. The directives, instructions, and manuals we reviewed in the table above were signed by the appropriate officials. For example, DOD Directive 5160.65 was appropriately signed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. DOD Instruction 5025.01 states that charters must define the scope of functional responsibility and identify all delegated authorities for the chartered organization. The SMCA charter defines responsibility and authorities, for example, by delegating to the Deputy Commanding General for Army Materiel Command the role of Executive Director for Conventional Ammunition and provides authorities as needed to execute the SMCA mission. To assess the extent to which the Department of Defense (DOD) has adequately maintained and shared information on the quantity, value, condition, and location of excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition for each military service, we reviewed DOD\u2019s inventory data on excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition held in the conventional ammunition awaiting demilitarization and disposal (CAD) stockpile as of February 2015 to determine how complete and accurate the data are. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. We also determined the extent to which the information in the services\u2019 ammunition inventory systems is useful for their purposes. We interviewed Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA) and service officials to learn how information on excess, obsolete, and unserviceable ammunition is shared. <mask_1>. Further, we conducted a data reliability assessment of the Air Force Combat Ammunition System, the Navy\u2019s Ordnance Information System, the Marine Corp\u2019s Ordnance Information System \u2013 Marine Corps, and the Army\u2019s Logistics Modernization Program by reviewing the services\u2019 responses to questionnaires on the internal controls they use to manage their systems. We applied Standards for Internal Control in Federal Government as our criteria, and found that the data was sufficiently reliable for determining whether DOD adequately maintained information on the quantity, value, condition, and location of excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition in its accounts and for our reporting purposes. The questions we sent the services solicited information on the controls they had implemented in their ammunition information systems. The questions seek to determine if there were controls that restricted access to the information system to prevent unauthorized access or inappropriate use and that there were data quality controls that ensured completeness, accuracy, authorization, and validity of all transactions. <mask_1>. We also interviewed officials on the visibility, accessibility, accuracy, and usefulness of the data on the CAD stockpile and determine if they have identified problems regarding the reliability of the data. <mask_1>. To examine challenges, if any, DOD has identified in managing the current and anticipated CAD stockpile, and if so, actions taken to address those challenges, we reviewed DOD reports on the management of the current CAD stockpile to identify any problem areas and DOD\u2019s plans to address these problems. We visited McAlester Army Ammunition Plant and examined the management of its ammunition demilitarization operation to include storage practices and a variety of methods to destroy the ammunition. <mask_1>. <mask_1>.<mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Additionally, we interviewed Army officials on the process they use to make demilitarization decisions. To describe DOD\u2019s policies and procedures governing the demilitarization of excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition and discuss the extent to which they are consistent with DOD guidance for developing policies and procedures, we obtained policies, procedures, and guidance on demilitarization. We determined that these policies, procedures, and guidance would be considered adequate if they conformed to DOD guidance on directives and instructions. <mask_1>.<mask_1>.<mask_1>.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. The Army has seven demilitarization locations that store 98 percent of the conventional ammunition awaiting demilitarization and disposal (CAD) Stockpile. Figure 3 below shows these seven demilitarization locations, the amount of the CAD stockpile at those locations, and the demilitarization capabilities at each location. 1. Autoclave - Autoclave capability removes and reclaims main charge cast explosives (such as TNT) from projectiles and bombs. Munitions are prepared for the autoclave by disassembly or cutting to expose the main explosive charge. They are placed in the autoclave and the vessel is heated using steam. As the munitions body heats up, the explosive melts and flows to the bottom of the autoclave for collection in heated kettles. 2. Hot Water Washout - Washout capability removes and reclaims main cast explosive charges from projectiles, bombs, and mines. Munitions are prepared for washout by disassembly to expose the main explosive charge. Munitions are placed over a washout tank where low-pressure hot water is injected into the cavity to wash out the explosives into a recovery tank. 3. Cryofracture - Cryofracture involves the cooling of the munitions in a liquid nitrogen bath, followed by fracture of the embrittled item(s) in a hydraulic press and the subsequent thermal treatment of the fractured munitions debris in order to destroy the explosives and decontaminate any residual metal parts. 4. Hydrolysis \u2013 Hydrolysis uses a sodium hydroxide solution to dissolve the aluminum casing and expose the energetic materials contained within. The sodium hydroxide solution then reacts with the energetic materials, breaking them down and rendering them inert. 5. Improved Munitions Convention Download \u2013 Joint Munitions Command officials describe this as a process developed to demilitarize artillery projectiles that contain submunitions, which are small bombs. The base plate of the projectile is removed to access the submunitions and they are removed for disposition on the open detonation range. The metal parts including the projectile body and base plate are often reused in the manufacture of new rounds. 6. Incineration - Incineration provides an environmentally acceptable means to destroy munitions not suitable for other demilitarization methods and reclaim the metal scrap for sale. Small munitions and/or components are fed on conveyor(s) into the incinerator where they burn or detonate. Metal residues are discharged and collected for salvage. 7. INERT \u2013 According to Joint Munitions Command officials, INERT is the shredding, cutting, or mutilation of munitions items, components, or packaging that do not contain energetic materials. 8. Open Burn/Open Detonation - Open burn and open detonation are the intentional combustion or detonation of explosives or munitions, without control or containment of the reaction, and are the preferred method for cost-effective demilitarization of many items. Open burn and open detonation techniques were the primary means used to demilitarize munitions for several decades. 9. Slurry Emissions Manufacturing Facility \u2013 According to Joint Munitions Command officials this facility combines energetic material recovered from munitions items with other commercial ingredients to produce blasting charges the mining industry uses. 10. Steamout - Steamout is similar to hot water washout in that both processes essentially melt out energetic fillers in large-caliber projectiles, bombs, and other munitions. With the steamout process, items are placed on an inclined cradle, and steam is jetted in to melt out the fill. The molten slurry is collected and sent to corrugate cooling pans. The pans are held in a vented and heated hood until the water is all evaporated and the explosive solidifies. The solidified explosive is broken into chunks, boxed, and then according to Joint Munitions Command officials, used as donor material for open detonation projects. 11. White Phosphorus Plant - The White Phosphorus-Phosphoric Acid Conversion Plant provides an environmentally acceptable means to demilitarize munitions containing white phosphorus by converting it into phosphoric acid. The munitions are punched to expose the white phosphorus and quickly burned. Smoke from the burning munitions is pulled through a closed loop ducting system into the wet scrubber in the acid plant system for conversion to phosphoric acid. The phosphoric acid is collected and packaged for sale. Metal parts are discharged and collected for salvage. <mask_1>. To develop an annual demilitarization plan, the optimizer produces an initial list of projects, in tons, that will result in demilitarizing the most ammunition possible based on factors entered into the optimizer. Officials stated they use the optimizer as a starting point in developing the annual demilitarization plan; they make adjustments to the optimizer output to maintain demilitarization capability at the depots and to balance the work load over the years. For the demilitarization of missiles, Army Aviation and Missile Command officials stated they do not use the optimizer because they prepare their plan using the number of missiles; however, they consider many of the same factors in determining what missiles to demilitarize in a given year. The optimizer is a database tool used to determine the ammunition, with the exception of missiles, that will be demilitarized, given certain parameters (e.g., inventory, depot capability and capacity, funding, transportation costs, and any mandatory workload requirements). The optimizer has been used by Joint Munitions Command since 1999 as a tool to assist in demilitarization program planning, provide justification to answer questions received from Congress as well as Army headquarters, and provide the most economic allocation of resources among the government depots. Further, the optimizer provides Joint Munitions Command with an auditable trail of decision making and an ability to provide a quick response to \u201cwhat if\u201d questions. <mask_1>.<mask_1>. 2. Depot capability, capacity, and costs of carrying out demilitarization \u2013 depot capability is the type of demilitarization work the depot has the ability to conduct. For example, most of the depots have the capability to conduct demilitarization through open burn and open detonation. Depot capacity is the amount of work that the depot has the ability to conduct by demilitarization capability. <mask_1>. The cost of carrying out demilitarization is an estimate, prepared by the depot, of the cost to demilitarizing specific ammunition using a particular demilitarization capability. Data on storage costs is not entered into the optimizer for cost calculations. 3. Funding \u2013 the amount of funding available for demilitarization based on the current fiscal year budget allocation. 4.<mask_1>. 5. Mandatory workloads \u2013 any directives or management initiatives that would change the priority of demilitarization work that must be conducted. For example, if the United States signed the Convention on Cluster Munitions, DOD would be required to demilitarize all cluster munitions within 8 years. This information would be entered into the optimizer to ensure the treaty requirement would be met. Joint Munitions Command officials cautioned that there are some inherent uncertainties in the optimizer process that affect the outcome. One of the uncertainties is the incoming workload. While Joint Munitions Command has an estimate of how much inventory will be generated each year for demilitarization, the estimates are not perfect and leave uncertainty in the quantity of items that will be turned over for demilitarization and the time at which those items will enter the CAD stockpile. Joint Munitions Command officials stated that the optimizer provides a good starting point for decision-making, based on the specific parameters described above, but they do not assign demilitarization projects based solely on the optimizer output. Officials stated that the optimizer produces a list of projects, based on tons, that would be most economical to demilitarize for that given year. However, adjustments are made to balance complex, expensive demilitarization projects with simple, inexpensive demilitarization projects. <mask_1>. This results in pushing the expensive demilitarization projects into the future, which may increase future demilitarization costs. Therefore, to maintain a balance between future demilitarization funding needs and the current funding provided for demilitarization, officials replace some of the inexpensive projects the optimizer recommends with expensive projects. Additionally, officials make adjustments to the optimizer results to ensure each depot is provided sufficient work to maintain demilitarization capabilities. Officials are concerned that if they do not provide some work to each of the depots, the depots would lose their demilitarization capability because some processes require specialized skills or training and retaining those personnel would be impossible if demilitarization was curtailed for a significant amount of time. The loss of trained personnel would create a significant deficit in training and delay the restart of any future demilitarization operations. Further, officials are concerned they risk losing their environmental permits if demilitarization operations were stopped at an installation for a significant amount of time. <mask_1>. Demilitarization officials at the Aviation and Missile Command stated they use similar factors in determining what missiles to demilitarize, including the location of the missiles, the capabilities and capacity of the depots, the estimated cost to demilitarize, and the funding available. Officials stated the Aviation and Missile Command does not use the optimizer tool, but instead the demilitarization officials coordinate with Product Manager Demilitarization to develop an annual missile demilitarization execution plan. In addition to the factors listed above, officials also consider the safety inspections that have been conducted on each missile and push any potentially unsafe-to-store items to the top of the demilitarization list. While Aviation and Missile Command demilitarization officials do not currently use an optimizer tool, they stated that they are considering whether an optimizer database would be feasible for use with missiles. For fiscal year 2015, the Aviation and Missile Command and Program Executive Office Ammunition officials stated they planned a demilitarization program of about $43 million, which would destroy about 141,598 missiles and components. In addition to the contact named above, Carleen Bennett (Assistant Director), George Bustamante, Lindsey Cross, Chane\u00e9 Gaskin, Kevin Keith, Carol Petersen, Michael Silver, Amie Steele, Alexander Welsh, Erik Wilkins-McKee, and Michael Willems made key contributions to this report.", "labels": ". Each military service\u2014the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps\u2014is responsible for assessing and making decisions regarding the ammunition in its inventory. The Army, as the Single Manager for Conventional Ammunition (SMCA), is responsible for centrally managing the demilitarization of all conventional ammunition including non-SMCA- managed items, for which capability, technology, and facilities exist to complete demilitarization and disposal. The services determine if the conventional ammunition in their accounts is unserviceable or above their needs, and if so, transfer the ammunition to installations as specified by the SMCA. However, before proceeding with demilitarization, any serviceable conventional ammunition that is beyond a service\u2019s needs is to be offered to the other services through an annual cross-leveling process. The services are to screen all conventional ammunition inventories that are beyond their needs by the other military services. Once the screening is complete, the service can transfer ammunition to the demilitarization account as DOD excess, except when safety issues require immediate disposal. As shown in figure 1, once it has been determined that the conventional ammunition is unserviceable or DOD excess, the services deliver the ammunition to one of the seven demilitarization depots in the United States and the ammunition is incorporated into the CAD stockpile. Appendix III provides a map of the seven demilitarization depots and an explanation of the demilitarization methods used by the Army. Multiple DOD entities have responsibilities related to managing and overseeing conventional ammunition, with the Army having a prominent role. The Secretary of the Army serves as DOD\u2019s SMCA and is responsible for centrally managing all aspects of the life cycle management of conventional ammunition, from research and development through demilitarization and disposal. The Program Executive Office for Ammunition has been designated the SMCA Executor and is responsible for executing all the functions of the SMCA. The Program Executive Office for Ammunition works with Joint Munitions Command and the Aviation and Missile Command to manage the demilitarization of conventional ammunition at seven Army depots and several commercial firms. The Program Executive Office for Ammunition budgets and funds the demilitarization and disposal of all munitions in the CAD stockpile. In addition, for ammunition, such as Bullpup rockets, that has no demilitarization process, the Program Executive Office for Ammunition plans, programs, budgets, and funds a joint-service research and development program to develop the necessary capability, technology, and facilities to demilitarize the ammunition. Within the Army Materiel Command, Army Aviation and Missile Command is responsible for the demilitarization of missiles and components, and the Joint Munitions Command is responsible for demilitarization of all remaining conventional ammunition. Army Aviation and Missile Command develops and implements the annual missile demilitarization operating plan, and Joint Munitions Command does the same for the CAD stockpile. Furthermore, Joint Munitions Command provides logistics and sustainment support to the Program Executive Office for Ammunition and the Army Aviation and Missile Command. Joint Munitions Command also oversees the storage of the CAD stockpile, maintains the CAD stockpile database, and arranges the transportation of conventional ammunition to the demilitarization site when necessary. The military departments have a process for collecting and sharing data on conventional ammunition through inventory stratification reports that they are required to prepare at least annually. They use these reports to identify inventory owned by one department that may be available to meet the needs of another department, as well as to identify both inventory deficiencies and excesses. DOD Manual 4140. 4. 01 Volumes 6 and 10 direct the military departments to assess the ability of the ammunition inventory to meet their needs by stratifying their inventories into various categories and requires them to prepare a report at least annually for internal purposes that lists the current inventory levels of all ammunition. The annual internal report divides the inventory into the categories of requirement-related munitions stock, economic retention munitions stock, contingency retention munitions stock, and potential reutilization and disposal stock. The manual also directs the departments to develop an external report identifying inventory in the same categories for each ammunition listed. The military departments are to use these reports, among other things, to identify opportunities for redistributing ammunition to meet unfilled needs in other military departments. The reports are then distributed to the other military departments to provide visibility. In addition, the Office of the Executive Director for Conventional Ammunition, which facilitates this process, compares the data in the inventory reports with data on planned procurements of ammunition. After the departments share their annual reports on ammunition inventory, including which ammunition could be reutilized; department officials participate in the Quad Services Review and review all the other departments\u2019 stratification reports to identify potential cross-leveling opportunities and request logistics data for items of interest. DOD guidance indicates that this cross-leveling process should be used to offset individual procurements of the military departments in coordination with the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. For example, the Executive Director for Conventional Ammunition reported in September 2014 that DOD avoids an average of $72 million annually in procurement costs by using the redistribution process regarding each service\u2019s inventory holdings that exceed their needs. 2 million. During the fiscal year 2014 redistribution process, the services transferred approximately 5 million items among each other, of which approximately 3 million were small-caliber items such as ammunition for rifles or pistols, about 2 million were for larger-caliber weapons such as mortars, and about 383,000 were a mixture of other types of ammunition. According to the Office of the Executive Director for Convention Ammunition\u2019s Fiscal Year 2014 Cross-leveling End of Year Report, the potential acquisition cost avoidance achieved in the 2014 cross-leveling process totaled about $104. DOD guidance requires that at the end of the annual cross-leveling process, any remaining unclaimed potential reutilization and disposal stock should either be claimed by another military department, recategorized, or designated for disposal, whether through the Defense Logistics Agency Disposition Services Account, or the CAD stockpile, as appropriate. We last reported on DOD\u2019s management of conventional ammunition in March 2014. We found that the Army\u2019s annual stratification report, which shows the status of ammunition inventory at a given point in time, did not include information on all usable ammunition items because it did not include missiles managed by the Army Aviation and Missile Command. Since the Army\u2019s missiles were not included in the annual stratification report, they were not considered during the cross-leveling process. Further, we found that items above the services\u2019 needs in a prior year that had been placed into the CAD stockpile were not considered in the cross- leveling process. We made recommendations to improve data sharing among the services, and DOD concurred with all of these recommendations. Among our recommendations was to include missiles managed by the Army Aviation and Missile Command in the annual stratification report, and DOD stated that starting with the March 2014 annual stratification meeting the Army would provide missile information for the cross-leveling process. As a result, 100 Javelin missiles were identified for transfer from the Army to the Marine Corps in fiscal year 2015, potentially saving the Marine Corps an estimated $3 million. Further, we recommended the Army include information on ammunition that in a previous year was unclaimed by another service and had been categorized for disposal. In response, DOD officials stated that all of the military services have visibility into the Army system that tracks ammunition categorized for disposal and they would direct the military services to consider such ammunition in the cross-leveling process. In 2015, the Navy and the Air Force identified materiel worth about $488,000 in the CAD stockpile from prior years they could use. The services maintain information on their conventional ammunition; however, some inventory records for ammunition in the CAD stockpile have incorrect or incomplete information on its condition and weight. As discussed earlier, each service has its own inventory information system to maintain its conventional ammunition inventory, which includes any unserviceable ammunition or ammunition above its needs in its custody. Consolidated information from the military services on the ammunition in the CAD stockpile is maintained in the Army\u2019s Logistics Modernization Program (LMP). DOD Instruction 5160. 68 directs the services to provide the SMCA with data on ammunition transferred for demilitarization and disposal operations. At times, the services have found particular items with a condition code indicating the materiel was serviceable, but the item\u2019s shelf life had expired, while other ammunition had performance issues that made it unacceptable. LMP lists the gross weight of an individual item (shell, missile, or cartridge), however, officials involved in the demilitarization of conventional ammunition use pro-weight, which includes the weight of the item plus its packaging. DOD uses weight data as a metric in managing the demilitarization of conventional ammunition. More specifically, SMCA officials use weight for (1) developing cost estimates for demilitarization projects; (2) determining what conventional ammunition should be demilitarized; (3) reporting the size of the CAD stockpile to the military services, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and Congress; (4) forecasting the amount of conventional ammunition to be transferred into the CAD stockpile in the future; and (5) reporting on what ammunition has been demilitarized. According to DOD officials, the reasons for the missing data in the CAD stockpile are related to the types of items transferred into the stockpile, such as older ammunition stocks that do not have complete weight data, nonstandard ammunition, foreign ammunition used for testing, components removed from larger weapons, and ammunition with records that migrated from legacy data systems. Officials from all the military services said they have access to LMP and they have used LMP to search the CAD stockpile for materiel they could use, but information on DOD excess is not widely shared with other government agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security, which also uses ammunition for purposes such as training exercises. When the services have been able to fulfill needs by drawing ammunition from the CAD stockpile, financial benefits have arisen both in reduced demilitarization costs over time and reduced new procurements. Officials stated that the Joint Munitions Command and Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (G-4) used informal methods to communicate with other government agencies on available excess ammunition. Communicating with other government agencies on available excess ammunition could help reduce the CAD stockpile. Section 346 of Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act, as amended, requires, among other things, that serviceable small arms ammunition and ammunition components in excess of military needs not be demilitarized, destroyed, or disposed of unless in excess of commercial demands or certified as unserviceable or unsafe by the Secretary of Defense. Before offering the excess serviceable small arms ammunition for commercial sale, however, this provision outlines a preference that DOD offer the small arms ammunition and ammunition components for purchase or transfer to other Federal government agencies and departments, or for sale to state and local law enforcement, firefighting, homeland security, and emergency management agencies as permitted by law. If DOD guidance outlining a systematic process to share information on excess ammunition had been in place, the Department of Homeland Security could have possibly been aware of and obtained selected ammunition needed for training classes. Transfers of ammunition to other government agencies, subject to certain requirements, could support DOD\u2019s goal of reducing its CAD stockpile in a manner consistent with section 346 of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 as amended. Without establishing a systematic means to communicate with and provide other government agencies with information on available excess serviceable ammunition, government agencies could be spending their funds to procure ammunition that DOD has awaiting demilitarization and could provide to them. In addition, without such a means, DOD could miss opportunities to reduce its overall demilitarization and maintenance costs by transferring such ammunition to other government agencies. DOD has identified a number of challenges in managing the demilitarization of conventional ammunition, and has taken actions to address them. These challenges include compliance with environmental regulations; treaties regarding certain types of ammunition; services\u2019 forecasts of excess, obsolete, and unserviceable ammunition; and annual funding. DOD officials stated they have identified the following challenges and are taking actions to address these challenges: Environmental Regulation Compliance: SMCA officials stated they must follow environmental laws in demilitarizing conventional ammunition and their compliance is governed by environmental permits that cover the design and operation of facilities that deal with waste management, noise, air, water, and land emissions. Many munitions are harmful to human health and the environment, and demilitarizing large quantities of ammunition requires the rigorous control and processing of toxic substances. According to SMCA officials, open burn and open detonation are the primary and cheapest methods to demilitarize conventional ammunition; further, some munitions can only be demilitarized by this process. All seven depots that demilitarize conventional ammunition have the capability to demilitarize ammunition through open burn/open detonation. The request is based upon the estimated disposal costs required to reduce the existing CAD stockpile, as well as costs for disposing of ammunition the services forecast they will submit for disposal. Each of the services is required to submit a 5-year forecast on the amount of ammunition they expect to turn in for demilitarization each year. Annual Funding: SMCA officials stated that the Army requests less funding than needed to meet its critical requirement each year, which could result in the CAD stockpile growing if the amount of ammunition demilitarized is less than the amount of ammunition transferred from the services during the year. The critical requirement is the funding necessary to demilitarize 3 percent of the existing stockpile and the full amount of ammunition the services plan to add to the CAD stockpile during the year. In December 2013, Army Audit Agency reported the Army Deputy Chief of Staff for Logistics (G-4) estimated the critical funding level for the demilitarization of conventional ammunition at approximately $185 million. The Department of the Army\u2019s budget request for conventional ammunitions demilitarization in fiscal year 2015 was $114 million and for fiscal year 2016 it was $113 million. DOD officials stated that in fiscal year 2015, it costs on average about $42 per ton to store conventional ammunition. This number was determined using the estimated cost to perform annual inventory counts, surveillance inspections of ammunition, and housekeeping movement of stocks to manage the storage space. Additionally, DOD officials stated that in fiscal year 2015, it costs on average about $2,000 per ton to demilitarize conventional ammunition. Based on our review of key DOD conventional ammunition demilitarization guidance, there is no requirement to conduct a cost comparison. DOD officials told us that since there is a large difference in the cost to store and the cost to demilitarize ammunition based on their estimates, they believe there is no need to conduct a formal analysis. In order to meet its goals, the department needs accurate data, which requires complete and accurate documentation of the items transferred into the stockpile each year by the services, as well as ammunition already in the stockpile. DOD does maintain data on conventional ammunition in the stockpile and uses it to manage demilitarization efforts, but officials have not fully maintained accurate and complete weight data on some ammunition items, which factors into their decision making about what to demilitarize in a given year. Such transfers could allow DOD to reduce demilitarization costs and the size of the CAD stockpile while also reducing the need for other government agencies to procure new stocks of ammunition. While at times transfers have led to cost savings, there has not been a formal means to regularly communicate with external stakeholders about the availability of excess ammunition in the stockpile, which is necessary to meet DOD\u2019s goals. Without a systematic means to communicate information on excess ammunition to other government agencies, DOD will miss opportunities to reduce the CAD stockpile and demilitarization costs through transfers. To improve the completeness and accuracy of information on the weight of items in the CAD stockpile\u2014the key measure used by DOD to manage the conventional ammunition demilitarization operation\u2014 establish a plan to (1) identify and record, to the extent possible, the missing or inaccurate weight information for existing ammunition records in the CAD stockpile and (2) ensure that all items transferred to the CAD stockpile, including for example components removed from larger weapons and nonstandard ammunition, have the appropriate weight data. To improve the visibility and awareness of serviceable excess ammunition in the CAD stockpile that could potentially be transferred to other government agencies, develop a systematic means to make information available to other government agencies on excess ammunition that could be used to meet their needs. DOD concurred with our first recommendation that the Secretary of the Army establish a plan to (1) identify and record, to the extent possible, the missing or inaccurate weight information for existing ammunition records in the CAD stockpile and (2) ensure that all items transferred to the CAD stockpile, including for example components removed from larger weapons and nonstandard ammunition, have the appropriate weight data. In response to our second recommendation that the Secretary of the Army develop a systematic means to make information available to other government agencies on excess ammunition that could be used to meet their needs, DOD stated that Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics would ensure that the Secretary of the Army is tasked to develop a systematic means to make information available to other government agencies on excess ammunition. The Department of Defense (DOD) has policies and procedures that help govern the demilitarization of excess, obsolete, and unserviceable conventional ammunition and DOD officials involved in the demilitarization of conventional ammunition stated they believe the policies and guidance issued are effective to govern demilitarization. For example, DOD Instruction 5160. 68 assigns responsibilities and mission functions for conventional ammunition management to the Secretary of the Army, the military services, and USSOCOM. The scope of the audit was limited to the materiel in the CAD stockpile and ammunition in the services\u2019 inventory that was unserviceable or in excess of the services\u2019 needs. We interviewed Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force officials to determine how they manage unserviceable ammunition and serviceable ammunition that is beyond the services\u2019 needs. After initial discussions with DOD officials, we determined that the department does not consider the value of ammunition in the management of its CAD stockpile so we did not review the value of the conventional ammunition. We interviewed service officials in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to learn how ammunition is managed once the decision is made to demilitarize and transfer it to the CAD stockpile. Lastly, we reviewed policies and legislation to determine what guidance was provided on communicating excess conventional ammunition to other government agencies, and we interviewed SMCA officials about the extent to which they communicate the availability of excess ammunition to other government agencies and the challenges involved with making conventional ammunition available to government entities outside of DOD. We selected McAlester Army Ammunition Plant to visit because a large portion of the CAD stockpile was stored there, and it used several methods to demilitarize ammunition. We also contacted the other six depots that store and demilitarize ammunition and requested the same information on the management of their respective ammunition demilitarization operations. in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps to identify challenges they face in managing the stockpile and discuss the actions they have taken to address the challenges. We interviewed SMCA officials and officials To describe DOD\u2019s average costs of storing and maintaining items in the CAD stockpile and the average costs of the disposal of items in the stockpile, we obtained fiscal year 2015 cost estimates for storing and demilitarizing ammunition from the Army Materiel Command\u2019s Joint Munitions Command, and interviewed officials about what factors were used to develop these cost estimates. We also reviewed a 2013 DOD report on the cost of demilitarizing conventional ammunition to determine the factors that drive demilitarization costs. Therefore, we compared the requirements in DOD Instruction 5025. 01, with the guidance governing demilitarization of conventional ammunition and determined whether DOD followed this instruction on how guidance documents should be developed and how often they should be updated. To determine the extent to which DOD policies and procedures on demilitarization of conventional ammunition are effective, we interviewed officials in the Army and contacted the demilitarization depots to obtain their opinions on the effectiveness and usefulness of DOD policies and procedures governing the demilitarization of conventional ammunition. To determine what conventional ammunition should be demilitarized, Joint Munitions Command officials stated they use a database tool called the Demilitarization Optimizer. The optimizer database uses several data points to determine what items should be demilitarized: 1.  Demilitarization inventory and forecasted additions to the CAD stockpile \u2013 the amount of ammunition currently in the CAD stockpile and the estimated amount of ammunition that the services determine they will add to the stockpile that year. For example, Letterkenny Munitions Center has the capacity to demilitarize 3,500 tons of ammunition each year by open burn and 1,250 tons by open detonation.  Packing, crating, handling, and transportation \u2013 the cost of moving ammunition to the appropriate demilitarization location. Since the optimizer attempts to maximize the amount of conventional ammunition demilitarized, it tends to recommend a number of inexpensive projects. For fiscal year 2015, the Joint Munitions Command and Program Executive Office for Ammunition officials stated they planned a demilitarization program of about $71 million, which would destroy about 67,640 tons of ammunition.

Much of the complex is no longer in productive use, but it contains vast quantities of radioactive waste related to the production of nuclear material, such as plutonium-contaminated sludge, and hazardous waste, such as solvents and hazardous chemicals. <mask_1>. It is a daunting challenge, involving the development of complicated technologies and costing about $220 billion over 70 years or more. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. These agreements often include the affected states as parties to the agreements. These agreements may be known as Federal Facility Agreements or Tri- Party Agreements. <mask_1>. These plans are submitted for approval to states authorized by EPA to perform regulatory responsibilities for RCRA within their borders or to EPA if the state does not have the required authority. Upon approval of the treatment plans, the state or EPA must issue an order requiring compliance with the approved plan. The agreements are generally known as Federal Facility Compliance orders. <mask_1>. These include the federal EPA and state environmental agencies, county and local governmental agencies, citizen groups, advisory groups, Native American tribes, and other organizations. <mask_1>. Other stakeholders advocate their views through various public involvement processes including site-specific advisory boards. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. By contrast, agreements that implement court-ordered settlements exist at only a few DOE sites, tend to be focused on a specific issue or concern, and have fewer associated schedule milestones. <mask_1>. The remaining agreements are based on either federal or state environmental laws and address a variety of purposes, such as cleaning up spills of hazardous waste or remediating groundwater contamination, and have a wide-ranging number of milestones. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In all, these sites account for 40 of the agreements and more than 4,200 milestones. <mask_1>. Of the 4,558 milestones completed, about 80 percent were finished by the original due date for the milestone. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. As table 2 shows, this percentage varied from a high of 95 percent at Rocky Flats to a low of 47 percent at Savannah River. Besides the 1,334 milestones currently yet to be completed, additional milestones will be added in the future. <mask_1>. Specifically: Many of the milestones do not indicate what cleanup work has been accomplished. For example, many milestones require completing an administrative requirement that may not indicate what, if any, actual cleanup work was performed. <mask_1>. Some agreements do not have a fixed number of milestones, and additional milestones are added over time as the scope of work is more fully defined. For example, one of Idaho Falls\u2019 compliance agreements establishes milestones for remedial activities after a record of decisionhas been signed for a given work area. Four records of decision associated with the agreement have not yet been approved. Their approval will increase the number of enforceable milestones required under that agreement. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Regulators at the four sites we visited told us they prefer to be flexible with DOE on accomplishing an agreement\u2019s cleanup goals. For example, they generally expressed willingness to work with DOE to extend milestone deadlines when a problem arises due to technology limitations or engineering problems. <mask_1>. Even in those few instances where DOE missed milestone deadlines and regulators were unwilling to negotiate revised dates, regulators have infrequently applied penalties available under the compliance agreements. DOE reported that regulators have taken enforcement actions only 13 times since 1988 when DOE failed to meet milestone deadlines. These enforcement actions resulted in DOE paying about $1.8 million in monetary penalties, as shown in table 3. <mask_1>. For example, for missing a milestone to open a transuranic waste storage facility at the Rocky Flats site, the site agreed to provide a $40,000 grant to a local emergency planning committee to support a chemical-safety-in- schools program. At the Oak Ridge site, because of delays in operating a mixed waste incinerator, site officials agreed to move up the completion date for $1.4 million worth of cleanup work already scheduled. Also, at three sites\u2014Paducah, Kentucky; Lawrence Livermore Main Site, California; and Nevada Test Site, Nevada\u2014the regulators either did not impose penalties for missed milestones or the issue was still under discussion with DOE at the time of our review. The President\u2019s budget submitted to the Congress does not provide information on the amount of funding requested for DOE\u2019s compliance requirements. <mask_1>. However, DOE headquarters officials evaluate individual site estimates and combine them into an overall DOE-wide budget, taking into account broader considerations and other priorities that it must address as part of the give-and-take of the budget process. As a result, the final budget sent to the Congress has summary information on DOE\u2019s programs and activities, but it provides no information on the portion of the budget needed to fund compliance requirements. DOE is not required to develop or present this information to the Congress. The President\u2019s budget typically states that the DOE funding requested is sufficient to substantially comply with compliance agreements, but it does not develop or disclose the total amount of funding needed for compliance. Officials at DOE headquarters told us that budget guidance from the Office of Management and Budget does not require DOE to develop or present information on the cost of meeting compliance requirements, and they said doing so for the thousands of milestones DOE must meet would be unnecessarily burdensome. They said their approach has been to allocate funds appropriated by the Congress and make it the sites\u2019 responsibility to use the funds in a way that meets the compliance agreement milestones established at the site level. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Also, DOE must respond to Executive Order 12088, which directs executive agencies to ensure that they request sufficient funds to comply with pollution control standards. Accordingly, each year DOE\u2019s sites develop budget estimates that also identify the amount needed to meet compliance requirements. The sites\u2019 process in developing these compliance estimates shows that a compliance estimate is a flexible number. For example, two budget estimates typically completed by the sites each year are the \u201cfull requirements\u201d estimate and the \u201ctarget\u201d estimate. The full requirements estimate identifies how much money a site would need to accomplish its work in what site officials consider to be the most desirable fashion. The target estimate reflects a budget strategy based primarily on the amount of funding the site received the previous year and is considered a more realistic estimate of the funding a site can expect to receive. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Table 4 shows how the compliance cost estimates related to compliance agreements changed under different budget scenarios at four DOE sites. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Because many of the compliance milestones are due in the future, sites estimate how much compliance activity is needed each year to meet the future milestones. If sites anticipate that less money will be available, they must decide what compliance activities are critical for that year and defer work on some longer-term milestones to future years. On the other hand, if more money is available, sites have an opportunity to increase spending on compliance activities earlier than absolutely necessary. DOE\u2019s compliance agreements focus on environmental issues at specific sites and do not include information on the risks being addressed. As a result, they do not provide a means of setting priorities for risks among sites or a basis for decision-making across all DOE sites. Risk is only one of several factors considered in setting the milestones in compliance agreements. Other factors include the preferences and concerns of local stakeholders, business and technical risk, the cost associated with maintaining old facilities, and the desire to achieve demonstrable progress on cleanup. The schedules for when and in what sequence to perform the cleanup work reflect local DOE and stakeholder views on these and other factors and may not reflect the level of risk. For example, regulators at DOE\u2019s Savannah River site told us that they were primarily concerned that DOE maintain a certain level of effort and they expected DOE to schedule cleanup activities to most efficiently clean up the site. DOE developed a decision model to determine how to allocate its cleanup dollars at Savannah River to achieve this efficiency. A group of outside reviewers assessing the system at the request of site management concluded that the model was so strongly weighted to efficiency that it was unlikely that serious risks to human health or the environment could alter the sequencing of work. <mask_1>. In response to concerns expressed by the Congress and others about the effectiveness of the cleanup program, DOE has made several attempts to develop a national, risk-based approach to cleanup, but has not succeeded. <mask_1>. The profiles were intended to provide risk information about the sites, make effective use of existing data at the sites, and incorporate stakeholder input. However, reviewers found that the site profiles failed to adequately address environmental or worker risks because the risks were not consistently or adequately documented. In 2001, DOE eliminated a support group responsible for assisting the sites with this effort, and the risk profiles are generally no longer being developed or used. A 1999 DOE-funded study to evaluate its efforts to establish greater use of risk-based decision-making concluded that none of the attempts had been successful. Common problems identified by the study included poor documentation of risks and inconsistent scoring of risks between sites. The study reported that factors contributing to the failure of these efforts included a lack of consistent vision about how to use risk to establish work priorities, the lack of confidence in the results by DOE personnel, the unacceptability of the approaches to stakeholders at the sites, and DOE\u2019s overall failure to integrate any of the approaches into the decision- making process. However, the study concluded that the use of risk as a criterion for cleanup decision-making across DOE\u2019s sites not only was essential, it was also feasible and practical, given an appropriate level of commitment and effort by DOE. DOE plans to shift its cleanup program to place greater focus on rapid reduction of environmental risk, signaling yet again the need for a national risk-based approach to cleanup. <mask_1>. However, in a February 2002 report, DOE described numerous problems with the environmental management program and recommended a number of corrective actions. The report concluded that, among other things, the cleanup program was not based on a comprehensive, coherent, technically supported risk prioritization; it was not focused on accelerating risk reduction; and it was not addressing the challenges of uncontrolled cost and schedule growth. The report recommended that DOE, in consultation with its regulators, move to a national strategy for cleanup. In addition, the report noted that the compliance agreements have failed to achieve the expected risk reduction and have sometimes not focused on the highest risk. The report recommended that DOE develop specific proposals and present them to the states and EPA with accelerated risk reduction as the goal. <mask_1>. DOE\u2019s fiscal year 2003 budget request includes a request for $800 million for this purpose. Moreover, the Administration has agreed to support up to an additional $300 million if needed for cleanup reforms. The set-aside would come from a reduction in individual site funding levels and an increase in the overall funding level for the cleanup program. The money would be made available to sites that reach agreements with federal and state regulators on accelerated cleanup approaches. Sites that do not develop accelerated programs would not be eligible for the additional funds. As a result, sites that do not participate could receive less funding than in past years. To date, at least five major DOE sites with compliance agreements have signed letters of intent with their regulators outlining an agreement in principle to accelerate cleanup\u2014Hanford, Idaho, Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, and Nevada Test Site. However, the letters of intent generally also include a provision that the letters do not modify the obligations DOE agreed to in the underlying compliance agreements. At Hanford, DOE and the regulators signed a letter of intent in March 2002 to accelerate cleanup at the site by 35 years or more. DOE and the regulators agreed to consider the greatest risks first as a principle in setting cleanup priorities. They also agreed to consider, as targets of opportunity for accelerated risk reduction, 42 potential areas identified in a recent study at the site. While accelerating the cleanup may hold promise, Hanford officials acknowledged that many technical, regulatory, and operational decisions need to be made to actually implement the proposals in the new approach. DOE is proceeding with the selection and approval of accelerated programs at the sites, as well as identifying the funding for those accelerated programs. At the same time, DOE is considering how best to develop a risk-based cleanup strategy. DOE\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management said that in developing the risk-based approach, DOE should use available technical information, existing reports, DOE\u2019s own knowledge, and common sense to make risk-based decisions. Because DOE\u2019s approach to risk assessment is under development, it is unclear whether DOE will be able to overcome the barriers encountered during past efforts to formalize a risk-assessment process. In the interim, DOE headquarters review teams were evaluating the activities at each site and were qualitatively incorporating risk into those evaluations. Compliance agreements have not been a barrier to previous DOE management improvements, but it is not clear if the agreements will be used to oppose proposed changes stemming from the February 2002 initiative. DOE has implemented or tried to implement a number of management initiatives in recent years to improve its performance and address uncontrolled cost and schedule growth. For example, in 1994, it launched its contract reform initiative; in 1995, it established its privatization initiative; and in 1998, it implemented its accelerated path- to-closure initiative. These initiatives affected how DOE approached the cleanup work, the relationship DOE had with its contractors, and, in some cases, the schedule for completing the work. <mask_1>. Because DOE\u2019s cleanup reform initiative is in its early stages, and site- specific strategies are only beginning to emerge, it is unclear how the site compliance agreements will affect implementation of DOE\u2019s latest cleanup reforms. For example, it is not yet known how many sites will participate in DOE\u2019s initiative and how many other sites will encounter cleanup delays because of reduced funding. However, early indications suggest caution. Parties to the agreements at the sites we visited were supportive of DOE\u2019s overall efforts to improve management of the cleanup program, but expressed some concerns about proposals stemming from the February 2002 review of the program. They said that they welcome DOE\u2019s efforts to accelerate cleanup and focus attention on the more serious environmental risks because such initiatives are consistent with the regulators\u2019 overall goals of reducing risks to human health and the environment. Most regulators added, however, that DOE generally had not consulted with them in developing its reform initiative and they were concerned about being excluded from the process. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. In such a case, these regulators are likely to oppose DOE\u2019s initiative. They told us that they most likely would not be willing to renegotiate milestones in the compliance agreements if doing so would lead to delays in the cleanup program at their sites. <mask_1>. The effect of compliance agreements on other aspects of DOE\u2019s initiative, especially its proposal to reclassify waste into different risk categories to increase disposal options, is also unclear. Some of the proposed changes in waste treatment would signal major changes in DOE assumptions about acceptable waste treatment and disposal options. <mask_1>. In addition, DOE is considering the possibility of reclassifying much of its high-level waste as low-level mixed waste or transuranic waste based on the risk attributable to its actual composition. However, at all four sites we visited, regulators said that it is unclear how DOE\u2019s proposed initiatives will be implemented, what technologies will be considered, and whether the changes will result in reduced cost and accelerated cleanup while adequately protecting human health and the environment. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Furthermore, the team leader said that, during the review, DOE was holding internal discussions about improving ineffective cleanup processes, such as contracting procedures. <mask_1>. According to the Associate Deputy Assistant Secretary for Planning and Budget, since the review team\u2019s proposals were made public in February, DOE has held discussions with regulators at all sites and headquarters about implementing the proposals. In summary, Mr. Chairman, DOE faces two main challenges in going forward with its initiative. The first is following through on its plan to develop and implement a risk-based method to prioritize its various cleanup activities. Given past failed attempts to implement a risk-based approach to cleanup, management leadership and resolve will be needed to overcome the barriers encountered in past attempts. The second challenge for DOE is following through on its plan to involve regulators in site implementation plans. DOE generally did not involve states and regulatory agencies in the development of its management initiative. Regulators have expressed concerns about the lack of specifics in the initiative, how implementation plans will be developed at individual sites, and about proposals that may delay or significantly alter cleanup strategies. Addressing both of these challenges will be important to better ensure that DOE\u2019s latest management initiative will achieve the desired results of accelerating risk reduction and reducing cleanup costs. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Subcommittee. This concludes my testimony. I will be happy to respond to any questions that you may have. For future contacts regarding this testimony, please contact (Ms.) Gary Jones at (202) 512-3841. Chris Abraham, Doreen Feldman, Rich Johnson, Nancy Kintner-Meyer, Tom Perry, Ilene Pollack, Stan Stenersen, and Bill Swick made key contributions to this report.", "labels": ". DOE is responsible for a nationwide complex of facilities created during World War II and the Cold War to research, produce, and test nuclear weapons. Since the 1980s, DOE has been planning and carrying out activities around the complex to clean up, contain, safely store, and dispose of these materials. DOE has reported completing its cleanup work at 74 of the 114 sites in the complex, but those were small and the least difficult to deal with. The sites remaining to be cleaned up present enormous challenges to DOE. DOE\u2019s cleanup program is carried out primarily under two environmental laws. Under section 120 of CERCLA, EPA must, where appropriate, evaluate hazardous waste sites at DOE\u2019s facilities to determine whether the waste sites qualify for inclusion on the National Priorities List, EPA\u2019s list of the nation\u2019s most serious hazardous waste sites. For each facility listed on the National Priorities List, section 120(e) (2) of CERCLA requires DOE to enter into an interagency agreement with EPA for the completion of all necessary remedial actions at the facility. Under amendments to RCRA contained in section 105 of the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992, DOE generally must develop site treatment plans for its mixed-waste sites. DOE carries out its cleanup program through the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management and in consultation with a variety of stakeholders. In most cases, DOE\u2019s regulators are parties to the compliance agreements. Compliance agreements in effect at DOE sites can be grouped into three main types (see table 1). Agreements of the first type\u2014those specifically required by CERCLA or by RCRA\u2014are in effect at all of DOE\u2019s major sites. They tend to cover a relatively large number of cleanup activities and have the majority of schedule milestones that DOE must meet. These agreements are typically between DOE and states. Most of the milestones DOE must meet are contained in the compliance agreements at its six largest sites\u2014Hanford, Savannah River, Idaho Falls, Rocky Flats, Oak Ridge, and Fernald. These six DOE sites are important because they receive about two-thirds of DOE\u2019s cleanup funding. DOE reported completing about two-thirds of the 7,186 milestones contained in its compliance agreements as of December 2001. The remainder of the completed milestones were finished either after the original due date had passed or on a renegotiated due date, but DOE reported that the regulators considered the milestones to be met. DOE\u2019s six largest sites reported completing a total of 2,901 of their 4,262 milestones and met the original completion date for the milestones an average of 79 percent of the time. Although DOE has completed many of the milestones on time, for several reasons DOE\u2019s success in completing milestones on time is not a good measure of progress in cleaning up the weapons complex. At DOE\u2019s six largest sites, DOE officials reported that about 73 percent of the 2,901 schedule milestones completed were tied to administrative requirements, such as obtaining a permit or submitting a report. Many of the remaining milestones are tied to DOE\u2019s most expensive and challenging cleanup work, much of which still lies ahead. Approximately two-thirds of the estimated $220 billion cost of cleaning up DOE sites will be incurred after 2006. DOE has reported that the remaining cleanup activities present enormous technical and management challenges, and considerable uncertainties exist over the final cost and time frame for completing the cleanup. Even though schedule milestones are of questionable value as a measure of cleanup progress, the milestones do help regulators track DOE\u2019s activities. Regulators at the four sites we visited said that the compliance agreements they oversee and the milestones associated with those agreements provide a way to bring DOE into compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. They said the agreements also help to integrate the requirements under various federal laws and allow regulators to track annual progress against DOE\u2019s milestone commitments. Regulators have generally been flexible in agreeing with DOE to change milestone dates when the original milestone could not be met. DOE received approval to change milestone deadlines in over 93 percent of the 1,413 requests made to regulators. Only 3 percent of DOE\u2019s requests were denied. Because regulators have been so willing to adjust milestones, DOE officials reported missing a total of only 48 milestones, or about 1 percent of milestones that have been completed. In addition to or instead of regulators assessing monetary penalties, several DOE sites agreed to other arrangements valued at about $4 million. DOE sites prepare budget estimates that include compliance cost estimates and submit them for consideration by DOE headquarters. Individual DOE sites develop information on the estimated cost of meeting compliance agreements, but the annual estimates are a flexible number. Sites develop these estimates because many of the compliance agreements require DOE to request sufficient funding each year to meet all of the requirements in the agreements. For each of these budget estimates, DOE sites also include an estimate of their compliance costs. As a result of this process, DOE sites usually have at least two different estimates of their compliance costs for the same budget year. The multiple estimates of compliance costs developed by individual DOE sites indicate that DOE sites have alternative ways of achieving compliance in any given year. DOE site officials said that how much DOE plans to spend on compliance activities each year varies depending on the total amount of money available. DOE officials said they revised the model so that serious risks receive greater emphasis. For example, in 1999, DOE pilot-tested the use of site risk profiles at 10 DOE offices. Without a national, risk-based approach to cleanup in place, DOE\u2019s budget strategy had been to provide stable funding for individual sites and to allow the sites to determine what they needed most to accomplish. DOE\u2019s new initiative provides additional funds for cleanup reform and is designed to serve as an incentive to sites and regulators to identify accelerated risk reduction and cleanup approaches. Based on our review of past evaluations of these initiatives and discussions with DOE officials and regulators at DOE sites, it appears that DOE proceeded with these initiatives without significant resistance or constraints as a result of the compliance agreements. Furthermore, they said DOE\u2019s initiative lacked specific details and they had numerous questions about the criteria DOE will use to select sites and the process it will follow at those sites to develop an implementation plan to accelerate cleanup and modify cleanup approaches. Most regulators said they would not view as favorable any attempt by DOE to avoid appropriate waste treatment activities or significantly delay treatment by reducing funding available to sites. In addition, these regulators said that if DOE misses the milestones after reducing the funding at individual sites, they would enforce the penalty provisions in the compliance agreements. For example, one change would eliminate the need to vitrify at least 75 percent of the high- level waste, which could result in disposing of more of the waste at DOE sites. DOE generally did not seek input from site regulators or other stakeholders when developing its latest initiative. DOE\u2019s review team leader said that when the review team visited individual sites, the team had not formulated its conclusions or recommendations and so did not seek regulators\u2019 views. To include regulators on the review team during these discussions, according to the team leader, could have created the impression that the criticism of DOE processes came from the regulators rather than from DOE and contractor staff.

The Institute reported that annual budgets for these services ranged from $85,000 to $11.2 million in the 21 states that provided responses to the survey it conducted. International adoptions in the United States have changed over time from a system that predominantly involved the adoption of infants and toddlers to one that has involved an increasing proportion of older children and those with special needs. <mask_1>. In addition, one study reported in 2013 that nearly half of more than 1,000 parents surveyed who adopted internationally said their children had diagnosed special needs. <mask_1>.S. families. About 7,000 children were adopted internationally in fiscal year 2013 compared to nearly 23,000 in fiscal year 2004 (see fig. 1). <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Young children with a history of institutional care often show poor attention, hyperactivity, difficulty with emotion regulation, elevated levels of anxiety, and increased rates of attachment disorders. For example, they may develop Reactive Attachment Disorder, which is characterized by serious problems in emotional attachments to others. The physical, emotional, and social problems associated with this disorder may persist as the child grows older. <mask_1>. For example, the adopted child may be violent toward siblings or parents. <mask_1>. Families may choose an unregulated child custody transfer because they were not sufficiently prepared for the challenges they experienced in their adoption, according to many child welfare and adoption stakeholders we interviewed. This lack of preparation may include inadequate information about the child\u2019s health, an insufficient home study to make a good match, and minimal pre-adoption training for parents. <mask_1>. Access to accurate information is critical to ensuring that a family is aware of the type of ongoing support they may need for the child. However, officials from 11 of 19 child welfare and adoption organizations and 5 of 15 adoption agencies said families who adopt internationally often do not receive complete information on a child\u2019s medical and behavioral needs before adopting. <mask_1>. USCIS officials also said some countries do not allow prospective adoptive parents to review medical history documents until after an adoption is finalized for privacy reasons. Many stakeholders also expressed concern that families may not have undergone an adequate home study to ensure they are a good match for their adopted child, and several noted that the home study is a critical point in the pre-adoption process, when social workers or adoption agency staff try to determine how families will handle challenges when parenting their adopted child. According to HHS officials, requirements for what should be assessed during a home study are determined by individual states for foster care adoptions. Home study requirements are determined by USCIS and the State Department for international adoptions. However, officials from 4 of 7 selected states and 8 of the 15 adoption agencies we interviewed expressed concerns about inconsistencies in the quality of home studies conducted by child welfare and adoption agencies across states. For example, Ohio officials said all child welfare and adoption agencies in their state are required to use a detailed home study format. They said they may not accept home studies conducted in other states that have less stringent requirements unless additional supporting documentation is provided, such as a background check and safety check of the home. Families also may not have received sufficient or targeted pre-adoption training to ensure they were prepared for their child\u2019s specific needs, particularly for international adoptions, according to most stakeholders we interviewed. For foster care adoptions, states each set their own training requirements for prospective parents, according to HHS officials. About half of all states require agencies facilitating these adoptions to provide prospective parents with at least 27 hours of training, according to data obtained from HHS officials in May 2015. Our seven selected states have requirements of 18 to 47 hours of training for foster care adoptions with some in-person required training in each state, according to state officials. Many of our selected states also use similar training models for foster care adoptions, including Parent Resources for Information, Development, and Education (PRIDE) and Model Approach to Partnerships in Parenting (MAPP), which were developed by various child welfare organizations. In contrast, State Department regulations require 10 hours of training for international adoptions, all of which can be online. This training must cover topics defined by the federal regulations. <mask_1>. State Department officials told us they are considering revisions to pre-adoption training requirements for international adoptions, which we discuss later in the report. States may set training requirements for international adoptions above the 10-hour minimum or may have required training topics. Two of our seven selected states require more than 10 hours of training, according to state officials. For example, Wisconsin officials told us the state requires 18 hours of training, and the same topics are required for international and foster care adoptions. This training covers issues such as attachment in adoptive placement, the effects of abuse and neglect, and cultural sensitivity. In addition, this training includes opportunities to cover issues specific to the individual child (see table 2). State Department officials said international adoption agencies may also have their own training requirements beyond those of federal and state agencies. For example, officials from one international adoption agency said they require 30 hours of training for parents wishing to adopt abroad. This includes training on grief and loss, the child\u2019s country of origin and cultural differences, the impact of institutionalization, and potential challenges and service needs. These officials said this expanded training is more costly for both the agency and prospective parents, and that some prospective parents thought the training was too cumbersome or expensive. <mask_1>. Several of these stakeholders explained that an adopted child may deal with continuing issues of attachment, identity, and loss of previous caregivers or biological parents. <mask_1>. Many stakeholders we interviewed suggested that families considering unregulated transfers may particularly need these intensive services. All seven of our selected states provide some kind of post-adoption services for families who adopted from foster care and internationally. For example, Wisconsin officials said the state provides parent training, a 24-hour information hotline, referral services, and mechanisms to link families to support groups and mentors, which are available to all adoptive families. Other types of services these selected states provide include lending libraries, newsletters, and brochures for parents. However, the seven selected states offered limited intensive services, particularly for international adoptions, according to our analysis of the information gathered from selected state officials. Officials from three states said their state offers counseling and other intensive services, such as case management and crisis intervention, to both families who adopted from foster care and internationally. However, officials from the six states that offer respite care and the four states that provide residential treatment told us their states provide these services exclusively to families who adopted from foster care. Some of these services have maximum time limits or are offered on a case-by-case basis. For example, Louisiana officials said their state offers respite care for up to 1 month, and Florida and Illinois officials said their states offer residential treatment services to families who adopted from foster care on a case-by-case basis. In addition, our seven selected states provide varying levels of financial support to eligible adoptive families through subsidies and cash assistance programs, according to the information gathered from selected state officials. <mask_1>. In addition, all of our selected states received federal funds under the Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program to provide subsidies to eligible adoptive families; the maximum subsidy amounts ranged from $400 to $2,700 per month in 2014. <mask_1>. The Donaldson Adoption Institute reported in April 2014 on a variety of post-adoption services provided by 49 states that responded to survey questions about such services. It found that about one-third of these states offered almost no post-adoption services other than a subsidy for adoptive families. In addition, the report found that the majority of these states had services that were open exclusively to families who adopted from foster care. Officials in four of our seven selected states told us that the need for post- adoption services exceeded the funding available from state and federal programs. <mask_1>. Our 2013 report found that local child welfare officials in four states we reviewed reported service gaps in multiple areas, including counseling and mental health services. We also reported that state and local child welfare agencies may face difficult decisions when determining which activities\u2014aimed at preserving families and preventing a child from entering foster care\u2014to prioritize and fund, particularly in light of the ongoing fiscal challenges these agencies face. Similar to our selected states, officials from 12 of the 15 adoption agencies we interviewed said they provide some level of post-adoption services to families, such as information and referrals. Officials in 4 of the 15 adoption agencies said they provide intensive services, ranging from trauma-focused therapy to a weekend respite care program. Officials from six adoption agencies noted that resource constraints have affected their ability to provide post-adoption services. Officials from the Council on Accreditation\u2014the organization responsible for accrediting agencies for international adoptions\u2014said some international adoption agencies have struggled to maintain their businesses due to the decrease in the number of international adoptions overall (a decrease of 70 percent between fiscal years 2003 and 2014). They said while some larger agencies have been better able to provide services because they are financially stable, this can be a challenge for other agencies. Another limitation to accessing post-adoption services that many stakeholders expressed concern about was the cost of intensive services, which can be expensive for all families. Officials in 3 of 7 selected states, 6 of 19 child welfare and adoption organizations, and 5 of the 15 adoption agencies we interviewed said services can be expensive, particularly intensive services such as mental health counseling and residential treatment. We have previously reported that the cost to support a youth in a residential setting can amount to thousands of dollars per month. In addition to cost, adoptive families may have challenges finding mental health providers that are \u201cadoption competent\u201d\u2014that is, knowledgeable about adoption-related issues, according to officials from five selected states, seven child welfare and adoption organizations, and eight adoption agencies. These stakeholders said mental health providers who do not understand issues unique to adoptive families will likely be less effective in helping these families work through issues. For example, one official told us adoptive families need therapists who can distinguish between normal adolescent behavior and a child acting out due to grief and loss resulting from his or her adoption. Several stakeholders also noted that families in rural areas may have even more difficulty accessing effective mental health providers. We reported in 2013 that a Florida behavioral health service provider had been advertising a child psychiatrist position for 5 years without success. <mask_1>. Lastly, families may not know about available services from their child welfare or adoption agency, and therefore do not seek help when needed, according to officials from four selected states and five adoption agencies. For example, Virginia officials said families that did not adopt from foster care may not know about support services they can access through their local child welfare agency. Wisconsin officials also said they struggle to find sufficient resources to provide outreach to all adoptive parents about state resources. Officials from two selected states also raised concerns that families may not remember whether their adoption agency provides post-adoption services. They explained that some families may not need services for years after an adoption is final because issues may not arise until the child reaches adolescence. By that point, families may no longer have contact with their adoption agency. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. A few of these officials further noted that families, including those who adopted from foster care and internationally, may fear that contacting an agency will prompt an investigation into how they care for all of their children. They also said families may be afraid that they will not be able to adopt again if they are involved with a child welfare agency. <mask_1>. In addition, officials in one selected state said parents cannot voluntarily relinquish custody of a child in their state (e.g., for care or services) without being charged with child abandonment. Officials in all seven selected states said families who decide to relinquish custody to the state may be required to pay ongoing child support. Similarly, families who adopted internationally may also be hesitant to reach out to their adoption agency. Representatives from 9 of the 15 adoption agencies we interviewed told us that families may be ashamed or embarrassed to contact the agency to discuss problems. Representatives from one adoption agency explained that families have gone through a rigorous home study process to prove that they will provide a good home to an adopted child. Thus, they said these families may be reluctant to contact their agency and admit that that they are facing challenges in their adoptions. <mask_1>. These transfers may involve an exchange of a power of attorney that may not be filed with or approved by a court of law, although it may be signed by both parties and notarized. State laws vary, but generally a parent may use a power of attorney to temporarily grant another person certain powers regarding their child\u2019s care and physical custody, such as the authority to make medical and educational decisions. For example, a military service member may sign a power of attorney to allow a family member or friend to take care of and make medical decisions for his or her child while he or she is deployed. However, because a power of attorney does not terminate the legal parent-child relationship, the adoptive parent still retains certain rights and responsibilities. For example, according to HHS, delegating responsibility for a child through a power of attorney does not insulate adoptive parents from state laws regarding imminent risk of serious harm. State laws determine any time limits (e.g., 1 year) for grants of power of attorney, and also establish the procedures required to make such an arrangement effective. For example, officials in three of our seven selected states told us their state laws do not require power of attorney documents to be approved by a court, and officials in one selected state said their laws require court approval in certain circumstances. However, officials in three of these selected states said they were not aware of any mechanisms in their states to track expired power of attorney documents to determine if families are attempting to use them to permanently transfer custody. Unregulated transfers are also difficult to track because many adoptions are not monitored after the adoption is finalized. For those international adoptions subject to reporting requirements set by individual countries, reporting may occur for a limited time. For example, according to the State Department website, one country requires adoptive parents to provide information about the adoption at certain time intervals for the first 2 years. Officials from the State Department and several adoption agencies we interviewed told us that while parents may sign a contract when they adopt a child saying they will report the required information to the adoption agency, parents may not comply with post-adoption reporting requirements, and agencies have little leverage to enforce compliance. <mask_1>. Our observations of forums on social media websites indicate that some parents have been using these venues to seek new homes for their children. We observed posts in five social media forums and found a total of 23 posts in which a person wrote that they were seeking a new family for their child. Among the 9 posts that included information on a child\u2019s age, those ages ranged from 7 to 16. Generally, parents in these forums who said they wanted to transfer a child indicated that they were in distress or crisis, and most often said they were seeking a new home because of the child\u2019s behavioral issues or severe mental illness. These children included those who were adopted from foster care and internationally. For example, one post asked for a new home for a 7-year- old boy who had been diagnosed with numerous mental illnesses, including Reactive Attachment Disorder, Oppositional Defiance Disorder, and autism, and who was physically abusive to his siblings and family pets. Several posters responded with information about their family and location or said that they had sent the poster a private message. Another poster wrote that her son, who she adopted internationally, had been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses and was currently hospitalized for psychiatric reasons, and she was seeking a new home for him. In addition, we found 40 cases in which a person posted that they wanted to adopt a child. In some cases, posters wrote that they had successfully completed a home study. In other cases it was not clear whether they had undergone a home study. For example, only a third of the posts we observed in one online forum referenced a home study\u2014either that the person seeking to adopt had completed one or the person seeking a new home for the child required one. <mask_1>. It is possible that conversations on the specifics of transferring a child were held either through private messages within the social media platform or by another means, such as email or phone. Because we did not investigate these posts further and because discussions between online participants can be continued privately, we were unable to determine whether a child was actually transferred to another family. Similarly, we were unable to determine, if such a transfer occurred, whether it was done through official means or an unregulated transfer. <mask_1>. These included the seven states we selected for interviews as well as eight states recommended by representatives from child welfare and adoption organizations because of legislative activity initiated in these states during the course of our review. <mask_1>. In addition, legislators in 10 of the 15 states introduced proposed legislation that had not been enacted as of July 2015 (see table 3). These selected laws, proposed legislation, and other actions within the 15 states reflect a variety of approaches to addressing unregulated transfers. <mask_1>. Other approaches may deter unregulated transfers by requiring that parents or certain other individuals report cases in which custody of a child may have been transferred. Some approaches may help prevent transfers from occurring. These included revising requirements for preparing prospective parents for adoption and increasing outreach about services available to families after adopting (see table 4). The five states that enacted laws to criminalize unregulated transfers or actions that could lead to these transfers made the following changes: Arkansas and Louisiana enacted laws that define the practice of \u201cre- homing\u201d and impose criminal penalties for those engaging in it. The laws provide that those who commit the offense of re-homing, which each state defines differently but generally includes transferring physical custody of a child to a non-relative without court approval with the intent of avoiding permanent parental responsibility (or assisting in such a transfer), will be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 and imprisonment for up to 5 years. Similarly, Florida enacted a law establishing the crime of \u201cunlawful desertion of a child,\u201d which provides that a caregiver who deserts a child (leaves the child with a non-relative with the intent to not return and provide for the child\u2019s care) under circumstances in which the caregiver knew or should have known that the child would be exposed to unreasonable risk of harm commits a third degree felony. Maine also enacted a similar law, modifying its definition of \u201cabandonment of a child.\u201d This law provides that a person is guilty of child abandonment if they transfer physical custody of a child to a non-relative without court approval with the intent to avoid or divest themselves of permanent parental responsibility. The law specifies that violation of this provision constitutes different classes of crimes, depending on the age of the child. <mask_1>. This law provides that delegations to a non-relative of a child\u2019s care and custody under a power of attorney may be effective for no longer than 1 year unless approved by a juvenile court, and those who violate this provision are subject to a fine of up to $10,000 and/or imprisonment for up to 9 months. In addition, the law states that any person who sends a child out of the state, brings a child into the state, or causes such actions to occur for the purpose of permanently transferring physical custody of the child to a non-relative is guilty of a misdemeanor. <mask_1>. Specifically, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Maine, and Wisconsin created or expanded prohibitions on who can place such advertisements, limited the purposes for which these advertisements can be placed, restricted the public media that can be used (e.g., the internet), and/or provided penalties for violations. <mask_1>. For example, several stakeholders said a power of attorney can be used for legitimate purposes, such as a military parent transferring custody of their child to a trusted friend while on deployment. They noted that placing additional conditions on power of attorney transfers can create a burden for these families. In addition, officials from three selected states and three child welfare and adoption organizations questioned how states could enforce the use of a power of attorney. Officials from one national organization specializing in adoption law said courts that may be involved in approving power of attorney agreements have other priorities and may not have time to monitor these agreements. Several stakeholders also said families often go online to access adoption resources and peer support forums. They said states need to consider the information that these online forums provide to adoptive families when considering laws related to the internet. <mask_1>. Specifically: Arkansas enacted a law that directed the state child welfare agency to adopt rules to ensure that post-adoptive services are provided to all parents who seek assistance to prevent their adoptions from being disrupted. Virginia enacted a law and made changes to its state child welfare programs to improve post-adoption services based on recommendations from a study it conducted on unregulated transfers. The law requires the state registrar to issue, along with new adoptive birth certificates, a list of available post-adoption services, and requires the state child welfare agency to provide a list of such services to the registrar and publish it on its website. In addition, Virginia officials said the state child welfare agency plans to modify the solicitation for its post-adoption services contracts to allow services to be provided by multiple regional providers rather than one statewide provider. Virginia officials said the intent of this change is to increase access to services for families statewide. Illinois and New York also made changes to their child welfare programs to increase outreach specifically to new parents who adopted from foster care, although these states did not make statutory changes. Illinois developed a pilot project for agencies facilitating foster care adoptions to host celebrations and social events to build relationships with these families and connect them with other families. <mask_1>. While many stakeholders we spoke with highlighted families\u2019 challenges with accessing pre- and post-adoption services as key reasons for unregulated transfers, they also commented on possible challenges in implementing certain policy options to improve access to and availability of such services. <mask_1>. They said states have been trying to bolster services, but have had limited success. <mask_1>. Many of these stakeholders said families experiencing difficulties in their adoptions need services, and unregulated transfers are a last resort for desperate families who feel they have no other option. They also stated that improving access to effective services may ultimately help all families meet the needs of their adopted children. Federal agencies have made some collaborative and individual efforts to address unregulated transfers, mainly by raising awareness of the need for improved pre- and post-adoption services and by sharing information with states (see table 5). <mask_1>. As shown in table 5, the State Department established an interagency working group in October 2013 to develop a coordinated federal response to unregulated transfers. Other federal agency participants are USCIS, HHS, and Justice. With input from the group, the State Department began work to revise regulations regarding international pre-adoption training requirements. <mask_1>. In addition, the revisions may include required in-person components for training. State Department officials said they plan to provide proposed revisions to the Office of Management and Budget by the end of 2015 for review, and the proposed regulations will be subject to a public comment period before being finalized. In addition, in February 2015, USCIS issued revised immigration applications and petitions which are used by certain families applying to adopt from certain countries. The revisions included a requirement that families disclose whether they have previously filed international adoption applications or petitions and the result of the filings (i.e., approval, denial, withdrawal). Additionally, the revisions require families to disclose if they have experienced a disruption or dissolution of an international adoption in the past. <mask_1>. For example, it issued a memorandum in May 2014 to states that encouraged them to promote services to all adoptive families and outlined various sources of available federal funds. The memo also shared information on how unregulated transfers may violate state laws and encouraged states to review their laws and policies. In addition, HHS awarded two cooperative agreements with 5-year project periods in October 2014 to national organizations to improve post-adoption services. <mask_1>. The National Quality Improvement Center for Adoption/Guardianship Support and Preservation aims to develop evidence-based pre- and post-adoption interventions and services for prospective and current adoptive families. Interventions and services will be evaluated at six to eight selected sites (e.g., state, county, or tribal child welfare agencies). Both projects are expected to be completed in September 2019. <mask_1>. In addition, they said HHS has been involved in discussions with states regarding post-adoption services over the years. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Specifically, Justice worked with the National Association of Attorneys General to gather information on existing state laws and pending legislative proposals to address unregulated transfers. Research fellows at the National Association compiled this information for all states. The organization also requested information from all state attorneys general offices, and received responses from six states and the District of Columbia. The organization completed this work in June 2015, and Justice officials said they are reviewing the study and will work with the interagency working group to determine next steps, if any, to be taken. <mask_1>. Officials from the Association said they are in the process of soliciting funds from private and non-profit organizations to support such a campaign. Despite these efforts, federal officials acknowledged that gaps in services for adoptive families remain, and determining how to provide them is a difficult task for public and private agencies working with these families. For example, HHS officials noted limitations to the federal government\u2019s ability to support post-adoption services. They said that while all adopted children will need some level of support after an adoption is final, the main source of federal support\u2014the Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program\u2014is limited, and is generally available only to families who adopted eligible children from foster care. Consistent with our findings in previous reports, HHS officials said funds from other federal programs that states can use to support services for private adoptions, including international adoptions, are limited. Officials said families who cannot afford services on their own must often rely on services supported by state and local funding or those provided by private adoption agencies, and funds from these sources are also limited. HHS officials told us that the administration included in its fiscal year 2016 budget request a legislative proposal that would provide an increase of $587 million over 10 years for pre- and post-adoption services. <mask_1>. Federal officials said they will continue to examine ways to address unregulated transfers. For example, the State Department has developed a charter to outline its goals and plans for future work. State Department officials said they will use this charter to facilitate future efforts with the interagency working group. We provided a draft of this report to the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and State and the Attorney General of the United States for review and comment. The Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and State provided technical comments that were incorporated, as appropriate. The Department of Justice had no comments. We are sending copies of this report to relevant congressional committees, the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and State, the Attorney General of the United States, and other interested parties. In addition, this report will be available at no charge on GAO\u2019s website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staffs have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-7215 or brownke@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff that made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix II. <mask_1>. To address these objectives, we used a variety of methods. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. Federal officials we interviewed included those from the Department of State (State Department), the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Justice (Justice). We interviewed representatives from 19 organizations that work on child welfare and adoption issues. <mask_1>. For example, these organizations specialized in certain aspects of adoption, including adoption law, home studies, pre-adoption training, and post-adoption services. <mask_1>. <mask_1>. These states were chosen based on factors such as legislative activity related to unregulated transfers in the state, as identified by representatives from child welfare and adoption organizations during our initial interviews, and the state\u2019s post-adoption programs. These states also provided variety in numbers of adoptions in relation to the state\u2019s population. Interviews with officials were conducted through site visits to Florida and Wisconsin, and phone calls to the remaining states. <mask_1>. Finally, we interviewed representatives from 15 international and domestic adoption agencies. The adoption agencies we interviewed were selected from those either recommended by national organization representatives or those licensed or accredited in the states we visited in- person to achieve variation in agency size, including budget and staff and types of adoptions facilitated. For example, 11 of the 15 adoption agencies facilitate international adoptions. The remaining 4 agencies facilitate domestic adoptions only, such as through the child welfare system (through a contract with the state child welfare agency) or privately. In the report we refer to different types of organizations when reporting information from our interviews with the 7 selected states, 19 child welfare and adoption organizations, and 15 adoption agencies. References to \u201cstakeholders\u201d include responses from officials in all three of these groups. In our interviews with stakeholders, we used a semi-structured interview protocol that included open-ended questions about reasons that families may consider unregulated transfers, types of services adoptive families may need to prevent them from resorting to these transfers, and types of services that are available to adoptive families. Information was volunteered by officials in each interview in response to these open- ended questions. Thus, the counts of organizations citing such responses vary. \u201cAll\u201d stakeholders represents 41 \u201cMost\u201d stakeholders represents 21-40 \u201cMany stakeholders\u201d represents 10-20 \u201cSeveral\u201d stakeholders represents 4-9 \u201cA few\u201d stakeholders represents 2-3 We reviewed relevant documents to corroborate information obtained in our interviews. To examine federal efforts related to unregulated transfers, we reviewed relevant documents obtained in our interviews with federal officials. We also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and policies on agency roles and responsibilities as well as GAO criteria on internal controls. <mask_1>. Through our interviews with representatives from child welfare and adoption organizations and others, we identified at least eight additional states that had initiated legislative activity related to unregulated transfer since we began our review: Arkansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, and South Carolina. <mask_1>. For proposed legislation, we reviewed only the version confirmed by the state officials. We did not do further research on the status of these proposals; therefore, additional changes may have been made that are not reflected in this report, and some proposed legislation included in the report may no longer be pending. We asked officials in the 15 selected and identified states to confirm whether their state had enacted a law, introduced proposed legislation, or took other relevant activity as of July 2015. We did not report on such activity after this date. Since we did not attempt to identify all activity related to unregulated transfers in all states, there may be other states with relevant legislative or other activity not included in our review. <mask_1>. While our search resulted in some literature on adoption dissolutions and disruptions as well as services for adoptive families, we were unable to locate academic literature regarding unregulated transfers. <mask_1>. Using keywords such as \u201crehoming\u201d and \u201cadoption disruption,\u201d we searched selected social media sites to locate online forums\u2014such as groups and message boards\u2014that parents might use to seek new homes for their children. For example, these forums were characterized on the sites as support groups for parents who wish to dissolve an adoption or whose children have behavioral issues. <mask_1>. We observed posts by participants in eight forums on two websites over a 15-month time period (January 1, 2014, through April 1, 2015). We analyzed posts on two of the eight forums that involved individuals who posted that they were seeking a new family for their child or who posted that they wanted to adopt a child. We did not find posts involving individuals seeking a new family for their child in the remaining six forums. The online posts we identified did not provide sufficient information to determine whether the posters intended to pursue an unregulated transfer, or to pursue an adoption or other legal placement. Since we did not investigate individual cases, our approach did not allow us to determine whether the information posted by online participants was accurate. Moreover, because discussions between online participants can be continued privately, we were unable to determine whether a child was actually transferred to another family and, if so, whether this was done through a court-approved process or through an unregulated transfer. One of the eight forums we observed was shut down in March 2015 by the social media site that hosted it. We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to September 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

An unregulated child custody transfer, commonly referred to as rehoming, is not an adoption. g. It is a practice in which parents seek new homes for their children and place them without the safeguards and oversight of the courts or the child welfare system. This practice does not pertain exclusively to adopted children; biological children may also be subject to unregulated transfers. However, media reports and child welfare and adoption organizations have focused on unregulated transfers of adopted children that involve families who may be unable or unwilling to deal with the emotional and behavioral challenges that may be caused by a child\u2019s pre-adoption conditions.  families. For example, some adopted children may have histories of long-term institutionalization (e. , orphanages), abuse, or other traumatic experiences that affect their behavior. An adoption may be terminated as a result of a disruption, which occurs before the adoption is finalized, or a dissolution, which occurs after the adoption has been finalized, generally in a legal proceeding. Under these circumstances, the child would go into the child welfare system or be legally adopted by another family. In contrast, unregulated transfers occur when parents intend to permanently transfer custody of their child to a new family without following these steps. Sometimes the parents will use a document called a power of attorney to delegate to the new family certain authority for the care and control of the child, although such documents do not terminate the legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the child. S. Because power of attorney arrangements are generally not overseen by any state or federal agency, information on the whereabouts of a child subject to an unregulated transfer using a power of attorney can be limited or unknown. In addition, because families who engage in an unregulated transfer do not follow the steps required for a legally recognized adoption, there may be no checks to ensure that the new home is an appropriate place for the child. There are different ways that a child can be adopted in the United States. International adoptions involve a child who was born in another country. International adoptions. Domestic adoptions can be adoptions from foster care, which involve children in the child welfare system whose biological parents have had their parental rights terminated. Other domestic adoptions include those conducted through private adoption agencies, attorneys, and others. Most domestic adoptions handled through private adoption agencies, attorneys, and others primarily involve infants or adoptions by a stepparent. Unregulated transfers do not follow the adoption process, which generally involves many steps to help ensure that the child is legally adopted and placed in an appropriate and permanent home. While the adoption process can be different depending on the state and type of adoption, it typically consists of: a home study performed by a licensed professional to assess the suitability of the prospective parents, such as their health, finances, and criminal history; an immigration application and petition, in the case of an international pre-adoption training for prospective parents, either online or in- person, for a specified number of hours on topics such as the adoption process and issues related to attachment and bonding; final approval of the adoption by a court, either in the United States or the child\u2019s country of origin; and post-placement or post-adoption services, in some cases, which can range from information and referral services and peer support groups to more intensive services for children with severe behavioral needs. For example, these intensive services can include mental health counseling, respite care programs to provide temporary relief for caregivers by placing children in short-term accommodations outside the home, and residential treatment, which involves extended treatment services to children while they reside outside the home. Multiple federal, state, and other agencies can be involved in different stages of the adoption process, depending on the type of adoption. Fees also vary by type of adoption; while foster care adoptions may not have any fees, international adoptions can involve substantial financial investments from families. As required under federal law and State Department regulations, international adoptions are generally conducted through accredited adoption agencies or approved persons. USCIS is involved in adjudicating immigration petitions for these children as well as setting federal home study requirements for international adoptions and determining the suitability and eligibility of prospective adoptive parents. The State Department also sets requirements for pre-adoption training that international adoption agencies and approved persons must provide for prospective parents. There are no federal requirements for post- adoption monitoring for international adoptions, according to State Department officials. However, officials said some countries of origin require adoptive families to provide periodic reports (e. , according to the State Department\u2019s website, one country requires families to provide reports every 6 months for 2 years following an international adoption). Individual states may also have separate licensing requirements for international adoption agencies operating in their state. Foster care adoptions. Foster care adoptions are typically conducted by state, county, and local child welfare agencies or private adoption agencies with which they contract. For these adoptions, states set requirements for home studies, pre-adoption training, and post-adoption services. Private domestic adoptions. States also set requirements for home studies, pre-adoption training, and post-adoption services for private domestic adoptions, generally through state licensing standards and other requirements for private adoption agencies, attorneys, and others. Some federal funding is available for adoption services, in addition to any funding from state, local, or other sources. Funding appropriated for Title IV-E of the Social Security Act makes up the large majority of federal funding dedicated to child welfare, comprising about 89 percent of federal child welfare appropriations (approximately $7. 4 billion of nearly $8. 3 billion) in fiscal year 2015. 3 billion) in fiscal year 2015, according to the Congressional Research Service. While the majority of these Title IV-E funds support children in the foster care system, the Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program provides grants to states for a portion of their costs to support families who adopted children with special needs, generally from foster care. For example, states provide ongoing monthly Adoption Assistance payments (subsidies) to eligible families that can be used to help pay for the costs of care for the child, which might include therapy and other post-adoption services. Funds appropriated for this program totaled about $2. 5 billion in fiscal year 2015, comprising about 34 percent of Title IV-E program funding. In addition, Title IV-B of the Social Security Act, which is the primary source of federal child welfare funding available for child welfare services, also provides funds that states can use to support adoptions by any family. For example, states may use funds to support pre- and post- adoption services, although funds can also be used for a variety of other purposes to keep children safe and in stable families. Federal appropriations for Title IV-B comprised about 8 percent of dedicated federal child welfare appropriations (approximately $664 million of nearly $8. Table 1 provides a summary of federal child welfare funding that states can use for adoption services, including programs under Title IV-E and IV-B of the Social Security Act. In addition to these programs, states may use savings generated from changes made to the eligibility criteria for the Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program for adoption services. These changes made additional children eligible for federal Title IV-E Adoption Assistance payments, thereby potentially freeing up state funds previously used for this purpose. The Preventing Sex Trafficking and Strengthening Families Act requires states to use 30 percent of these savings for post- adoption and related services. In addition, states may use different combinations of federal funds not specifically dedicated to child welfare to support adoption services, such as funds available under the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families block grants, Medicaid, and Social Services Block Grants. While states can use federal funds to support adoption services for families, we reported in January 2013 that federal funding for services designed to prevent children from entering foster care\u2014such as adoption support services\u2014can be limited. HHS does not collect information on how much states spend in federal funds specifically for post-adoption services. In addition, our prior work has shown that some states may not have information on the extent to which they use these federal funds for adoption services. Although states are to use savings generated from changes to the Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program for child welfare services, we reported in May 2014 that only 21 states reported calculating these savings for fiscal year 2012, and 20 states reported difficulties performing the calculations. In 2014, the Donaldson Adoption Institute attempted to collect information on states\u2019 annual post-adoption service budgets, excluding Title IV-E Adoption Assistance program subsidies. According to State Department data, less than 8 percent of children adopted internationally in fiscal year 2013 were younger than 1 year compared to over 40 percent in fiscal year 2004. The State Department, HHS, and others have reported that the changing landscape of international adoptions is attributable to many different factors, including positive cultural factors and socio-economic conditions in other countries that have made it easier for biological families to take care of their children or to adopt domestically\u2014decisions that have impacted the number of children eligible for adoption by U. Children in foster care may also be more likely to have special needs than children in the general population. According to a national survey conducted in 2008 and 2009, more than 42 percent of children ages 18 months to 17 years who were placed in a foster family home following an investigation of abuse and neglect were found to be at risk for an emotional or behavioral problem and potentially in need of mental health services. Multiple studies have shown that abuse and other maltreatment can cause changes in the brain development of children, and these changes may leave them more vulnerable to depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other behavioral or mental health issues. Studies show that children who are institutionalized\u2014for example, in orphanages prior to being adopted by a family\u2014are often subject to deprivation and neglect. Families who adopt children with severe behavioral or mental health issues may face situations which can put the family in crisis. One study reported in 2014 that in 23 percent of cases where adoptions were dissolved, the adopted child was a threat to the safety of other children in the home. Many stakeholders we interviewed\u2014including officials from selected states, child welfare and adoption organizations, and adoption agencies\u2014 expressed concern with the adequacy of the information provided to prospective parents on the behavioral and mental health conditions of a child adopted internationally. State Department officials explained that some low-income countries lack sufficient mental health care providers, making it difficult for international adoption agencies to ensure that children are accurately evaluated prior to adoption. Officials we interviewed from 5 of our selected states, 12 child welfare and adoption organizations, and 11 adoption agencies told us that this training may be insufficient, particularly since an increasing proportion of children adopted internationally are older and have special needs due to an extensive history of institutionalization and trauma. Officials in most of the selected states, child welfare and adoption organizations, and adoption agencies we interviewed expressed concern that families may choose an unregulated transfer when they cannot access post-adoption services to help them cope with or avoid reaching a crisis point in their adoption. While services to help adoptive families can include information, referrals, and peer support groups, families who adopted children with severe behavioral needs may need more intensive services, such as mental health counseling, respite care, and residential treatment. For example, Ohio officials described a state program that uses Title IV-B and state revenue funds to provide up to $10,000 per child per year to pay service providers in 2014, with an additional $5,000 available per year if the child is recommended for residential treatment by a mental health provider. However, they are generally only available to eligible families who adopted children with special needs from foster care, and information is limited on how much families use their subsidies for services, such as counseling, versus other expenses for their adopted child, such as food, clothing, and day care. Our prior work has shown that child welfare agencies have struggled to meet the service needs of families. In a 2011 report, we found that child psychiatrists and psychologists were among the most difficult specialist referrals to obtain for children in low-income families covered by Medicaid and the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, both of which can cover children adopted from foster care and internationally. Families in need of help may be reluctant to ask child welfare agencies for assistance, according to officials from three child welfare and adoption organizations and four adoption agencies. For example, these officials noted that there is a stigma associated with contacting child welfare agencies since those agencies are also generally responsible for investigating cases of child abuse. Officials in five of our seven selected states acknowledged the dilemma that families face if they contact child welfare agencies for services. Because unregulated child custody transfers are an underground practice that happens outside the purview of the courts and the child welfare system, they are difficult to track, and no federal agency keeps statistics on their occurrence. In addition, officials in our seven selected states said their state does not specifically monitor whether adopted children remain with their families after the adoption is finalized. Some posters said they had adopted children already in the home, and some wrote they had adopted a previously adopted child, although it was unclear whether they had legally adopted the child or whether the child was transferred without court oversight. We identified 15 states in which laws were enacted, proposed legislation was introduced, or recent changes had been made to child welfare programs that were intended to safeguard children who may be subject to unregulated transfers. Of these 15 states, 7 enacted legislation and 3 made changes to child welfare programs. The most common approaches were to criminalize unregulated transfers or actions that may lead to these transfers, and to restrict the advertising of children or potential homes for placement. Wisconsin enacted a law that placed parameters on parental delegations made through a power of attorney, and established criminal penalties for unauthorized transfers of children across state lines. Six states enacted laws to restrict the advertising of children or potential homes for adoption or other permanent placement. Officials from selected states, child welfare and adoption organizations, and adoption agencies we interviewed discussed some trade-offs and considerations in implementing these approaches to deterring unregulated transfers. In addition to approaches that would deter unregulated transfers, 4 of the 15 states we reviewed enacted laws or made changes to child welfare programs to improve post-adoption services for families. New York developed a brochure for adoption agencies to provide to new adoptive parents that includes information on unregulated transfers and possible sources of help with post-adoption needs. For example, officials from nearly half of the child welfare and adoption organizations we spoke with said building a strong infrastructure for adoption services can be a lengthy and costly task. Given limited funding, officials from most selected states, child welfare and adoption organizations, and adoption agencies we interviewed expressed concern about the level of support for post- adoption services. In some instances they have also collaborated with non-governmental organizations that have relationships with state child welfare and law enforcement agencies, such as the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children and the National Association of Attorneys General. State Department officials said the revisions may potentially include an increased number of minimum required hours and additional required content, drawing from training curriculum used by child welfare agencies for prospective parents in foster care adoptions. HHS has also taken a number of actions to help improve access to adoption services. The National Adoption Competency Mental Health Training Initiative aims to build a web-based training curriculum for child welfare professionals and mental health practitioners to meet the mental health needs of adopted children, develop a national certification process for those completing it, and evaluate its outcomes and effectiveness. HHS officials also noted that information on pre-adoption requirements and post-adoption services, by state, is available on HHS\u2019s Child Welfare Information Gateway, a website that provides information, resources, and tools on child welfare, child abuse and neglect, out-of-home care, adoption, and other topics. For example, HHS hosted a conference on the needs of adopted children\u2014including post-adoption services\u2014in August 2012, and was involved in a forum on unregulated transfers and services for adoptive families in February 2014 through the National Association of State Adoption Programs, Inc. Because states are responsible for much of the work to improve adoption services, the interagency working group has collaborated with national organizations to share information with states. In addition, the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children is working to develop a national outreach campaign to raise awareness about unregulated transfers and provide information on alternatives to this practice. They said this funding would target services to families with children who may be subject to unregulated transfers as well as those at risk of entering foster care due to an adoption in crisis. GAO examined (1) the reasons adoptive families consider unregulated child custody transfers, and services that exist to support these families before they take such an action; (2) what is known about the prevalence of these transfers; and (3) actions selected states and federal agencies have taken to help address such transfers. Specifically, we conducted interviews with 45 agencies and organizations, including officials from federal and selected state agencies, child welfare and adoption organizations, and adoption agencies, to acquire a range of perspectives on this topic; reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations, selected state laws, and federal and selected state policies; reviewed and analyzed documentation provided by officials we interviewed; conducted a search of related literature and reviewed relevant articles; and searched online forums on selected social media sites to find illustrative examples of families who may be considering unregulated transfers. Because children adopted domestically as infants and those in biological families may be less likely to have mental health issues due to trauma and institutionalization, and reports of unregulated transfers have primarily pertained to children adopted internationally or from foster care, our report focuses on international and foster care adoptions. To understand why families consider unregulated child custody transfers, what training and services are available to adoptive families, and actions selected states and federal agencies have taken to help address such transfers, we conducted interviews with 45 agencies, states, and organizations, including federal officials, representatives from national child welfare and adoption organizations, officials from selected states, and representatives from adoption agencies. The 19 organizations we interviewed were selected to represent a variety of views on adoption and child welfare- related policy, training, and research. We interviewed the following child welfare and adoption organizations and experts: American Academy of Adoption Attorneys; American Bar Association\u2019s Center on Children and the Law; Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children; Center for Adoption Policy; Center for Adoption Support and Education; Child Welfare League of America; Coalition for Children, Youth, and Families; Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute; Council on Accreditation; the Donaldson Adoption Institute; Joint Council on International Children\u2019s Services; Madeline Freundlich; Maureen Flatley; National Center for Missing and Exploited Children; National Center on Adoption and Permanency; National Conference of State Legislatures; North American Council on Adoptable Children; Spaulding for Children; and Voice for Adoption. In addition, we interviewed officials from state child welfare agencies and other relevant offices in seven selected states: Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Ohio, Virginia, and Wisconsin. In the states selected, the team conducted interviews with officials from state child welfare agencies and other relevant offices, such as those from state attorney general offices, departments of justice, and adoption agency licensing offices. To examine selected state efforts related to unregulated transfers, we reviewed information on recently enacted laws, proposed legislation, and other documents provided by child welfare and other agency officials in our seven selected states. For these eight identified states, we also reviewed relevant laws, proposed legislation, and other documents provided by child welfare and other agency officials in these states. We conducted a search of literature related to unregulated child custody transfers in order to gather information about why families may consider these transfers, what policies exist to safeguard children who might be subject to such transfers, what training is required to adopt, and what services are available to adoptive families. We searched online forums on selected social media sites to find illustrative examples of families who may be considering unregulated child custody transfers. The results of our searches were not exhaustive as we were unable to ascertain whether we identified most or all social media sites and forums with online activity that may relate to unregulated child custody transfers.
