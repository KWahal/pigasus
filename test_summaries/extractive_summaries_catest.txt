The Legislature finds and declares that Section 3 of this act, which adds Chapter 17.2 (commencing with Section 7283) to Division 7 of Title 1 of the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies.The Legislature further found that Secure Communities harmed community policing and shifted the burden of federal immigration enforcement onto local law enforcement agencies.
The Priority Enforcement Program has many similarities to Secure Communities, including the checking of fingerprints for immigration purposes at the point of arrest; the continued use of immigration detainers, which have been found by the courts to pose constitutional concerns; and the reliance on local law enforcement to assist in immigration enforcement.

(g) It is hereby declared that the purpose and intent of the Legislature in enacting this section is to provide for a method of determining whether a sufficient amount of representative sales information is available for land under use restriction to ensure the accurate assessment of that land.It is also hereby declared that the further purpose and intent of the Legislature in enacting this section and Section 1630 is to avoid an assessment policy which, in the absence of special circumstances, considers uses for land that legally are not available to the owner and not contemplated by government, and that these sections are necessary to implement the public policy of encouraging and maintaining effective land use planning.
==================================
(c) With the enactment of Chapter 1007 of the Statutes of 1991, the Legislature began restricting public access to civil case records in unlawful detainer proceedings.The state has a housing crisis that requires revising the current restrictions on public access to civil case records in unlawful detainer proceedings.(e) The difficulty of securing affordable housing in competitive rental markets is also worsened by the existing law governing access to civil case records in unlawful detainer proceedings.

(b) California’s robust nondiscrimination laws include protections on the basis of religion, race, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, and disability, among other characteristics.
The California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Chapter 7 (commencing with Section 12960) of Part 2.8 of Division 3 of Title 2 of the Government Code) and the Unruh Civil Rights Act (Section 51 of the Civil Code) prohibit unlawful discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodation, and services provided by business establishments on the basis of certain personal characteristics, such as sex, race, color, religion, ancestry, national origin, age, disability, medical condition, genetic information, marital status, or sexual orientation.Section 11135 of the Government Code specifically prohibits unlawful discrimination on the basis of many of these same characteristics in the conduct, operation, or administration of any program or activity that is by the state or by any state agency, funded directly by the state, or receives any financial assistance from the state.

Since this act would authorize local agencies to make disclosures of public records by posting the public records on their Internet Web sites, thus making public record disclosures by local agencies more quickly and cost effectively, this act furthers the purpose of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution.3.
The Legislature finds and declares that Section 1 of this act, which amends Section 6253 of the Government Code, furthers, within the meaning of paragraph (7) of subdivision (b) of Section 3 of Article I of the California Constitution, the purposes of that constitutional section as it relates to the right of public access to the meetings of local public bodies or the writings of local public officials and local agencies.
