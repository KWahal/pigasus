A person agrees to engage in an act of prostitution when, with specific intent to so engage, he or she manifests an acceptance of an offer or solicitation to so engage, regardless of whether the offer or solicitation was made by a person who also possessed the specific intent to engage in prostitution. No agreement to engage in an act of prostitution shall constitute a violation of this state unless some act, in addition to the agreement, is done within this state in furtherance of the commission of an act of prostitution by the person agreeing to engage in that act. This bill would make technical and clarifying changes to those provisions.==================================(1) When a peace officer is responding to a call alleging a violation of a domestic violence protective or restraining order issued under Section 527.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the Family Code, or a violation of a protective order issued by the court of another state, tribe, or territory, the officer has probable cause to believe that the person against whom the order is issued has committed an act in violation of the order, the officer shall, consistent with subdivision (b) of Section 13701, make a lawful arrest of the person without a warrant and take that person into custody whether or not the violation occurred in the presence of the arresting officer.

These duties include, among other things, reviewing and approving curriculum for approved educational and training programs, determining whether the curriculum satisfies the requirements established by the board, and notifying the appropriate governmental educational authority of any changes in curriculum.

The Medi-Cal program is, in part, governed and funded by federal Medicaid program provisions. One method by which these services are provided is pursuant to a contract with a public entity, in which the contract states that the individual will perform specified duties, including but not limited to, providing administrative support to a school or other educational institution, as specified. This bill, for the first time, would specify that unemployment compensation benefits, extended duration benefits, and federal-state extended benefits are payable on the basis of service to which benefits are payable on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as benefits payable on the basis of other service, if there is a contract or a reasonable assurance that the individual will perform services for any educational institution in the second of the academic years or terms. By expanding the scope of the duties of a state, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on==================================Under existing law, a person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is under 16 years of age is guilty of either a misdemeanor or a felony, and is punished by imprisonment in a county jail not exceeding one year, or by imprisonment pursuant to subdivision (h) of Section 1170 for 2, 3, or 4 years. This bill would additionally punish a person who engages in an act of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator, and would impose additional penalties. By expanding the scope of the crime of unlawful sexual intercourse, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state.

The state board is required to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to establish rules for the natural gas and pipeline industries, as specified. The act requires all state agencies, except for the State Air Resources Board, to adopt rules and regulations consistent with the goals and purposes of the act and to take all reasonable measures to achieve the goals and purposes of the act, including, but not limited to, reducing the use of natural gas. (2) The Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act, with specified exceptions, requires that meetings of a state body be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend. This bill would delete the Bagley-Keene Open Meeting Act provision. (3) The California Global Warming Solutions Act requires all state agencies, except for the State Air Resources Board, to adopt rules and regulations in an open public process to establish and monitor sources of emissions of greenhouse gases. The act also requires all state agencies, except for the State Air Resources Board, to adopt rules and regulations consistent with the goals and purposes of the act and to take all reasonable measures to achieve the goals and purposes of the act,==================================(1) Existing law establishes a campus-based mandatory fee, other than a student success fee, as defined, for all students enrolled in a California State University campus. Existing law requires the Chancellor of the California State University to approve a new student success fee or an increase to an existing student success fee, as defined, before all of the following requirements are satisfied. (2) Existing law establishes a campus-based mandatory fee, other than a student success fee, that may be reallocated without an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of either the student body or a campus fee advisory committee if the vote that established the fee authorized an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee. Existing law requires the Chancellor to rescind any portion of the fee that is reallocated without an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of either the student body or a campus fee advisory committee if the vote that established the fee authorized an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee. This bill would instead require the Chancellor to rescind the portion of the fee that is reallocated without an affirmative vote of a majority of the members of either the student body or a campus fee advisory committee if the vote that established the fee authorized an alternative or automatic reallocation mechanism for that fee. (3) Existing law requires the Chancellor==================================Existing law authorizes a registered process server to levy under a writ of attachment in the name of the court.

Existing law requires the registered process server to return to the court a copy of the writ and the fee within 5 days of the levying officer has completed his or her duties. This bill would instead require the registered process server to return to the court a copy of the writ and the fee within 5 days of the levying officer has completed his or her duties. The bill would delete the requirement that the registered process server return a copy of the writ and the fee to the court within 5 days of the levying officer has completed his or her duties. By imposing additional duties on the taxpayers, this bill would impose a state-mandated local program. The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement. This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these statutory provisions.==================================
