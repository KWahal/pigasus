The act requires the board to consult with public and private stakeholders, including local workforce development boards, local governments, and nonprofit community-based organizations that serve the supervised population, to develop and implement a specified action plan, and to report the results of the grant program to specified legislative committees. This bill would modify the purpose of the Supervised Population Training Grant Program to delete references to community-based organizations and instead provide that the purpose of the program is to identify and assist persons who face barriers to employment, including, among others, persons who are formerly incarcerated, have a criminal history, and who are on probation, subject to mandatory supervision, or postrelease community supervision, and who are eligible for the program.

This bill would establish an income reporting threshold for recipients of CalWORKs benefits and would require a county to redetermine eligibility and the grant amount for a recipient if the recipient reports an increase in income for the first through fifth months of a current semiannual reporting period, as specified. The bill would also require a county to redetermine eligibility and the grant amount for the following month if the county has verified the report and determined the recipient’s financial eligibility and grant amount. When a recipient reports an increase in income that results in a change in eligibility, the county shall discontinue the recipient with timely and adequate notice, effective at the end of the month in which the income was received.
