The California Constitution requires that the water resources of the state be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable and that the waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented. The WaterConserve in Landscaping Act requires the Department of Water Resources to update its model water-efficient landscape ordinance by regulation and prescribes various requirements for the updated model ordinance. The law requires each agency to adopt either the updated model water-efficient landscape ordinance or an updated model water-saving landscape ordinance. The model ordinance can apply if the local agency does not make a selection. The bill would require the department to create the California Water Efficient Landscaping Program to encourage local agencies and water sholders to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances, and support and enhance water inefficient grass. The Water Efficient Landscaping Fund would be created and money would be available for certain purposes upon appropriation by the Legislature.

The county board of education is responsible for the administration and operation of juvenile court schools. The bill would express the Legislature's intent that juvenile court schools have a rigorous curriculum that prepares students for high school graduation and career entry and that they can fulfill the requirements for admission to the University of California. The governing board of a school district can prescribe other requirements for students in order to get a diplomas, if the law prescribes the course of study a student is required to complete in order to get a diplomas. The law exempts pupils in foster care and homeless children from local graduation requirements and requires a school district and county office of education to accept coursework from those pupils while they attend another public school, a juvenile court school or a nonpublic, nonsectarian school. The bill would make that exemption and requirement to accept the courses that were completed applicable to former juvenile court school pupils. The bill would require a county office of education to issue a graduation certificate to a student who does not complete all of their requirements but does complete their statewide requirements, even if they attend a juvenile court school.
